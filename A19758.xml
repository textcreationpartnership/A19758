         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

which vvith great perfection your ſelues doe
practiſe. The third, the Rule of Penance,
in which this bleſſed Saint liued and dyed.
<pb facs="tcp:15857:5"/>
The firſt, for Religious men. The ſecond, for
Religious virgins. The third, for all virtuous
people of ether ſex: in vvhich this holy Virgin
profited ſo vvell, that although she were of
the lovvest ranck for the number of Rules, yet
vvas she not the lowest in holie obſeruance, but
ſingular for ſanctitie here in earth, as she is

            <p>WIth tongues of Seraphins and ſpirit from
heauen I wold manifeſt to the worlde
the things ſo ſoueraigne, which for his honour
and glory God wrought in his faithfull and lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
eſpouſe ſiſter Ioane of the croſſe, with who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he ſo enlarged the hand of his mercie, as being
ſo ſingular as they are, they require ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
attention to reade them, and particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion
to write them. And that I might obtaine
the ſame, &amp; the end of my deſire, hauing viſited
her holie bodie, and the places where ſhe was
borne, liued, and dyed, and ſeeking with parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
care the trueſt papers that could be had, for
to write her life, I follow fourteene authenticke
<pb facs="tcp:15857:7"/>
informations, and a very auncient manuſcript
(which ſhee her ſelfe dictating, by commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of her Angell keeper) ſiſter Marie Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt
a diſciple of hers did write, to whom miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly
to this effect, and to write, the booke of
ſermons which the ſeruant of God preached, our
Lord gaue the grace to reade and write, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſhe did not know it, according as by many
witneſſes hath beene proued: and that after the
death of this bleſſed woman, ſhe appeared to
another religious in the quire veſted with ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,
with a booke of gold open in her handes,
repreſentinge that which ſhe had written of
the thinges of the glorious Ioane. And to all
this authoritie, as great as it is, another is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
no leſſe, which is, the miracle of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptibilitie
of her bodie, ſeene with my
eyes, and handled with my handes, when I
wrote this, ſhe being incorrupte, intire, and of
excellent ſauour, accordinge as to the honour
and glorie of God we will ſpeake hereafter more
at large.</p>
            <p>So admirable are the thinges of this ſeruant
of God, as they oblige me, that they may better
be vnderſtood, to doe not only the office of an
hiſtorian, but alſo of a paraphraſte, with particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
annotations &amp; ſcholia in the margent, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
are explained many difficulties: in ſuch ſort
<pb facs="tcp:15857:8"/>
as whoſom-euer may read them, and draw moſt
ſauorie fruite out of them. And becauſe to ſome
it ſeemed not conuenient that they ſhould goe
in a vulgar tongue, they haue beene reformed in
this laſt impreſſion: and let this be the firſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſement
of this Prologue.</p>
            <p>The ſecond, that writing the life of a ſeruant
of God, ſo full of viſions, reuelations, extaſies,
and apparitions of Angels, and deuils, I am
bound to giue ſome notice of theſe thinges, at
leaſt as much as a briefe Prologue permitteth.
For the which it ſhall be of much importance,
ſomewhat to vnderſtand by roote the force and
proprietie of the word viſion, with which ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
are comprehended and declared all theſe
thinges; as with particular energie the holie
tongue declareth deriuing it from the verba Raa,
which ſignifieth to ſee with the eyes of the body
the thinges which God reuealeth, and to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
them with the ſpiritual eyes of the ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le.
And hence it is, that to the Prophets to whom
God ſhewed ſo many viſions and merueils, the
ſacred ſcripture calleth them <hi>videntes</hi> with the
participle of the ſame verbe Haroe; and viſion,
the reuelation communicated to them, which is
a kind of ſupernaturall knowledge. And becauſe
in man there are three principles of knowledge,
the exterior ſenſe, the imagination, and the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding:
<pb facs="tcp:15857:8"/>
ſo alſo the Doctors and Saints doe
reduce to three kindes of viſions, all kinde of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelations
which God maketh to his ſeruants:
conforme to one of theſe principles with which
a man knoweth them. <hi>S. Banauentur. de profectu

and cap. 1. Apoc.</hi>) The ſecond is called, <hi>Imaginary,</hi>
when the ſoule without helpe of the corporall
eyes, ſeeth the things which God reuealeth her,
by meane of ſome imaginarie figure. Of this kind
of viſions were thoſe which S. Iohn ſaw in his
Apocalipſe, being in that vniuſt baniſhment in
the ile of Patmos. The third and laſt of theſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
is, when the ſoule ſeeth &amp; knoweth cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
<pb facs="tcp:15857:9"/>
that which God reuealeth to her. And it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Intellectuall,</hi> becauſe the vnderſtanding, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
hauing for meane any figure of ſenſible thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
or imaginarie, doth know all that which
God reuealeth to her. And this laſt is held for the
higheſt and moſt principall of all, becauſe it is
moſt like to the viſion which the bleſſed enioy
in glorie.</p>
            <p>The raptes which the Hebrewes call Tarde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
which is to ſay, a profound ſleepe, and
the Greekes Extaſie, which ſignifieth a going
out or flight of the ſoule (not becauſe the ſoule
goeth out of the body, and returneth to it, which
would be to grant a great error, and euery foote
death and reſurrection of the bodies) but becauſe
in raptes he which ſuffereth them, is as if he were
dead, or a ſleepe, an effect proper to loue, which
according to S. Denis is that which cauſeth exta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies
in the ſoule, &amp; draweth a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of himſelfe,
transforming him into that he loueth. (<hi>S. Dioniſ.
de diuinis nominibus cap.</hi> 4.) And this eleuation
the diuines call extaſies. (<hi>S. Thomas 2. 2. q. 28. ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulo.</hi>
3.) Vnto the which rapte addeth, a certeine
kind of viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce on the parte of the obiect, which
moueth the power of the ſoule which rauiſheth
it and ſtrongly draweth it to it ſelfe (although
with mightie ſweetneſſe) drawing her from her
ſenſes; the which when ſhe is rapte in God with
<pb facs="tcp:15857:9"/>
the force of loue, in ſuch ſorte transformeth her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
into him, that ſuſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding her powers, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paireth
for ayde to the ſuperior portion of the
ſoule: and not hauing forces to reſiſt the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall
violence, nor able withall to repaire to
the corporall ſenſes, ſhe is wanting to them and
doth not giue them ſtrength, nor ſendeth the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall
facultie to the partes of the bodie; without
the which, neither the eares can heare, nor the
eyes ſee, nor the noſe ſmell, nor the taſte, nor
the feeling touch. (<hi>Medina. 1. 2. q. 8. a. 3. S. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
2. 2. 175. artic.</hi> 1.) for the which thoſe
which are rapte, neither <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eele colde, nor heat,
hunger, thirſte, nor wearineſſe.</p>
            <p>And therefore ſome thinke, that when the
ſoule enioyeth theſe extaſies &amp; raptes ſhe doth
not merite in the ſame, nor demerite, thinking
that her libertie remayneth not entire, freely to
vſe reaſon, as a bodie that were a ſleepe. But
the ſame iudgement is not to be made of them
as is of ordinarie and common ſleepes: for if in
theſe the vſe of reaſon be hindered and the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
in raptes it is not ſo, but more free
and disburdened to vnderſtand and contemplate
the things which God communicateth in them
to the ſoule, as is eaſily vnderſtood in looking to
the ende which God hath in theſe extaſies and
raptes, which he giueth not to the end his fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
<pb facs="tcp:15857:10"/>
loſe time in them and remaine for that ſpace
without iudgement, but that the ſoule gathered
together, disburdened and free of the diſquiet
of the ſenſes, more feruorouſly and freely may
worke. And ſo the workes which they doe in
the extaſies and raptes, are of virtue, and done
with more light and claritie then thoſe which
are done out of it, according as is gathered out
of the doctrine of the Saints, and we are taught
by perſons, to whom God hath done ſo ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
fauours. (<hi>S. Thom. 1. 2. q. 113. a. 3. ad 2. ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutio</hi>
2. And thus we might <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

themſelues in a worke ſo high, the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
ſences doe faile, and remaine as it were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleepe
to exterior things.</p>
            <p>To conclude with this matter, becauſe I wold
neither enlarge my ſelfe in it, nor leaue it faſting
of ſo ſauorie bittes, let it be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered, that when
God ſpeaketh to men, moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly it is wont
to be by miniſterie of the Angels, repreſenting
the diuine perſon, and in his name they receiue
meſſages, and diſpatch them, ſpeaking not in a
third perſon as meſſingers do, who in anothers
name giue their errand, and carrie backe the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere;
but as legates, and viceroyes, who hold
the turne &amp; place of himſelfe that ſendeth them.
<pb facs="tcp:15857:10"/>
This was more vſed in the old law, then in the
law of grace; in which, for the dignitie of it,
and for the loue which Chriſt beareth to ſoules,
ſometimes himſelfe appeareth to them, viſiteth
them and comforteth them, as is manifeſt by
expreſſe places of the new teſtament, and the
Saints doe relate in manie hiſtories. (<hi>S. Thomas

The hiſtorie of the woundes of our holie Fa. S.
Francis is well knowen, whom our Lord Ieſus
Chriſt viſited, not by miniſterie of Angels, but
in his proper perſon when he imprinted his

            <p>And our Lord is wont to make theſe appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
deſcending to the earth, and together re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
in heauen; which although to our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parance
difficult, is not to God impoſſible, yea
rather among learned men, it is an opinion ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
probable and ſecure, as alſo it is in good phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke,
and theologie, which Scotus teacheth with
<pb facs="tcp:15857:11"/>
manie others which follow him, that one and
the ſame bodie, by the power diuine, may be
at once quantitatiuely in two places diſtinct and
different. The Angels when they appeare and
ſpeake to the Saints, and the diuels when they
torment and ſcourge, take (for to exerciſe theſe
actions) bodies apparant and phantaſtike of ayre
imperfectly mixte, applying actiue things to paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue,
as teaceth the ſubtilitie of Scotus, and the
glorious Father. S. Auguſtine. And although
it be true, that theſe bodies in which they ſhew
themſelues and appeare, are not true bodies of
fleſh and bloud as ours are, (for according to S.
Thomas, to worke properly theſe things, which
are vitall actions, they ought to be the ſoule of
the ſame bodie in which they appeare, and as the
forme thereof to animate it:) yet for all this, ſo
great is the force which the ſpirites haue aboue
all things corporall and viſible, as they doe with
them what they wil, moouing the tongue of the
body feinedly, to ſpeake, the feete to go, the eyes
to ſee, and with the ſame facilitie, that the ſoule
doth ſerue her ſelfe of her members, the ſpirite
ſerueth it ſelfe of theſe which it maketh. For to
as much as this commeth the power of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
good or euill. And let this ſerue the curious

ſpake to her: asking if she had tould that which
shee had commanded her: and she anſwered:
that shee had told it to her Father, and to her

then the Ladie ſaid: that shee should publish it,
and should tell it to the prieſt, and to the people
without any feare or trembling.</p>

shee came vnto her in the forme that other

and raiſed her ſelf vp. And that the ſaid Ladie
ſaid to her: Be not afraid: And asking her who

bowed her knees before the altar of the B. virgin
Marie, and told publickly to the prieſt, and to
all the people, all what hath bene aboue ſaid. And
by and by the Prieſt, the Church wardens, the
cunſtables, and all the chiefeſt men of the towne,
bearing much deuotion to our B. bleſſed Ladie
the virgin ſaint Marie, who had shewed ſuch a
miracle on the ſaide Agnes, began with great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion,
with Croſſes, candles, and torches lighted
in their hands, and all barefooted, to goe in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
with all the children which they could

carryed a Croſſe of wood, for to place it where
our B. Ladie had taken her by the hand, and made
vpon her the ſaid ſigne.</p>
               <p>6. Going beyond the place where they dreſſe
their corne, thinking to enter into the vineyards,
the ſaid Agnes who went before the children,
turned her head, and ſaid to Lopes of Lorbes, and

and that therfore shee wold goe to ſee that which

went with the Croſſe and ſaide: that aſſoone as
shee ſeuered herſelf from the proceſſion, the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
our B. Ladie came, and they went together,
at the right ſide of the ſaid Agnes, and that she
neuer spake a word vnto her, vntill they came to
the place where shee had giuen her the ſaid ſigne,
and that then the virgin S. Marie tooke the Croſſe
in her hands, and bowing her Bodie, pitched it
faſt in the ground, and commanded her to kneele
on her knees, with her face towards the proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and that shee shold wishe the people, there
to errect a Church vnto her, which they should
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:15857:16"/>
call S. Maries: and commanded her that shee
should returne with the proceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the Church
of the towne, and that she should ſtand in the
ſame before the altar of S. Marie with ſome pure
and innocent people, all that day, and that night
vntill the next day: that they shold ſay two maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of S. Marie on her altar, and that at the end
of eache maſſe, they should ſay the goſpell vpon
the head of the ſaid Agnes, and they shold carrie
her to ſaint Maries of Guadalupe, where shee
shold bee two dayes, and that they should carrie
with her foure poundes of wax, and by and by
shee should be ſound, &amp; her hand should be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued,
and the marck be taken from her. This
is that which Agnes affirmed vnder oath.</p>
               <p>7. And the people ſeeing theſe maruaills, ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the place, where the virgin ſet her moſt bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
feet, and with the graines of the ſand, in
which remained the ſignes of her plantes, they
healed manie ſick. They adored alſo the holie
Croſſe, and ſetting men to keept it, the proceſſion
returned to Cubas with the child: and all being
done with her which the B. virgin commanded,
her parents brought her to Guadalupe: in the
way shee did ſome miracles in the cure of the
ſick, and at her returne shee healed of the paine
of the ſide, one of the men which came with her:
shee was in Guadalupe three dayes, and the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d

day her hand was vnlooſed, and she remained
perfectly whole: the miracle being publicke and
euident, being ſeene by the Prior and Monckes
of that howſe, with manie other people, who
tooke it for a teſtimonie of the truth of the fact.
When Agnes returned from Guadalupe, before
shee went home, shee went to the place, where
our B. Ladie had placed the Croſſe, and as she
ſtood adoring it, the moſt holie virgin appeared
vnto her the ſecond time, and ſpake vnto her, and
from thence she returned with her parents home.
Thoſe of Cubas found themſelues ſo fauoured,
for that the mother of God had viſited them nine
times, that within one yeare they builded her a

wherof, in the yeare 1481. was borne this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant
of our Lord, on the day of the holie Croſſe
in Maye, in the holie ground of Toledo, in Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zanna,
a towne of the ſame archbishopricke, and
of the holie Church of Toledo, called S. Maries:
becauſe shee that was to liue and dy in the howſe
of the moſt holie virgin, should be borne in a
towne of her iurisdiction and lordshipp, and that
the ſame shold be called Hazanna, being God
was to worck in her, by the interceſſion of his
moſt holie mother, ſo admirable a fact, and ſo
worthie an exploit in matter of ſanctitie and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.
Her parents, being of the ſame nation, were
called Iohn Vaſquez, and Catharine Gutierzes,
both of them Catholiques, and very virtuous,
and honorablie endued with the goodes of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
God gaue them this daughter, and in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme
they called her Ioane: shee was ſcarcely

ſucking only once in the day, for ſo ſoone
would our Lord manifeſt in his ſeruant, the

that God wrought them in ſigne of other greater
which by them he wold worke when they shold
attaine to the vſe of reaſon, and in ſigne of their
future holineſſe and excellencie.</p>
               <p>2. The holines of this happie child was ſuch,
as from ſo tender age, not only shee faſted the
fridayes (as hath beene ſaide) but alſo one time
shee was 3. dayes without ſucking, or returning
to herſelf: wherfore, the afflicted mother belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

vpon the image of the glorious Apoſtle, which
ſtood on the altar, the child laughed, and by and

that shee had ſeene the Apoſtle S. Bartholomew,
who touching her with his hand, healed her and
tooke away the ill colour of her face, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

was ſummer time, as she paſſed by a ſtreet, shee
remembred, howe a little before they had carried

conſideration, that she fell from the aſſe on which

taking her vp from the ground, found her with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any kind of ſenſe, and carried her in his armes
to her fathers howſe, where she was a great
while without comming to her ſelf; and as shee

recounted, when after shee came to her ſenſes,
shee was carried in ſpirite to a moſt faire place,
where shee ſawe many Ladies maruailouſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
&amp; among them one, who to her ſeeming,
was the Queene of them all, according to her

of great beauty, which ſaid to her: what doſt

which is the mother of almightie God: the bleſſed

but I will ſay the Aue Maria, and kneeling on her

that I go my ſelf (to fulfill the promiſe of my

She communicated her deſires with an aunt she

S. Dominicke in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uent of Toledo, and wold
haue beene a nunne with her, and asked it of her
Father, and kinsfolke, who hindred her, putting

was brought vp, to ſteale her away, and to bring
her to that monaſterie. But God hauing deſigned
her for that of S. Marie of the Croſſe, altered all
thoſe purpoſes in his ſeruant, which shee had
before to be religious with her aunt. It ſeeming
to her that to be with her, were a point of little

and bloud, purpoſed firmly not to take the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitt

reſpect of parents, kinred, or any other thing of
the world: ſo much enamored was her ſoule of
God, and ſo deſirous to ſerue him and to pleaſe
him.</p>
               <p>3. In the ſame towne of Hazanna, the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
child had ſome principall vncles, and very
rich, who deſired to haue her in their howſe, it
ſeeming to them that she would be better kept
and more ſecure then in the howſe of her grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother:
with much entreatie, they obteined it
of her Father, &amp; moſt contented with the iewell,
they carried her to their howſe, and committed
to her the gouernment of all the familie, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
she were yong, yet was ſhe moſt prudent,
and obedient to all. Heer beganne our Lord to
bring to light her virtues, and wonderfull pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
to be admired in men of great ſtrength,
how much more in ſo dedicate a child as shee
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:15857:21"/>
was. All the dayes of obligation, she faſted in
bread and water, and ſometimes shee was two
or three dayes without eating, and like another
Cecilie, shee ware a haire cloth next vnto her
flesh: she whipped herſelf with chaines of iron,
vntill she drew bloud, and there was neuer heard
from her a vaine or idle word. When she went
about the howſe or did any labour, shee pinched
her armes: and if shee were at the ouen, or in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
place where shee was not ſeene, shee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtripped
them, and vndreſſed her head, to ſcorche
herſelf with the flames of the ouen, and to ſuffer
paine for the loue of God, and with this shee
was ſo hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble, that shee held her ſelf for vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
of the bread that shee eat, and of the earth
she troad vpon.</p>
               <p>4. Beſides the hairie and pricking ſhirt that
wounded her body in a thowſand places, shee
ware chaynes next vnto her flesh, and although
it were in winter time when the nights are cold
and long, yet after the ſeruants were gone to bed,
shee roſe vp, and all naked, she remained only
with the at shirt of haire vpon her, and in this
manner paſſed all the night in prayer, vntill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the break of day, when with much ſilence
and quiete shee returned to her bed, without any
one perceiuing of it. But one time, the ſeruants
ſeeing that shee was miſſing out of her bed, and
that shee returned late vnto it, they told it to her
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:15857:21"/>
aunt: who being vexed about it, commanded a
ſeruant that ſhee ſhold follow her in ſecret, and
eſpie whether ſhee went at ſuch houres. And ſo
the night following<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the maide ſeeing that ſhee
was not in her bed, waited for her at the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
doore, thinking that ſhee was gone out: but
within a little while ſhee heard her weep before
a certain image: and coming to her, ſhe perceiued
her to be couered as ſhe thought, with haire or
hard mattes, and vpon her knees; for being by
night, ſhe could not ſee her perfectlie. The mayde
diſſembled the matter for that time, and the next
morning ſhe told her miſtreſſe of the ſanctitie of
her neece, and of the ſteps of virtu wherin ſhee
walked: for which the ſeruant of God was full
of great grief; and began with newe care, to ſeeke
another place where with more quiete and peace
(without being ſeene or perceiued of the people)
ſhee might alone enioy God.</p>

of her vncles, entring into a chamber, ſhee ſawe

and two Seraphines with diuers pots in their
hands, which did nothing elſe but take water out
of the fountaine, and often to fill and ouerturne
the pots, who as often as ſhee entred into that
chamber (the which ſhe did oftentimes) looked
vpon her, laughed and made very merrie with

her: and ſhee ſaid ſhee receiued ſo much comfort

was done with ſo much water as was drawe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out
of that fountaine, for ſhee neuer ſawe where they
put it, nor did ſhee know, vntill ſome yeares af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
her good Angell told her, that, that foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
was miraculous, and the water which the
Seraphines powred out, to repreſent the grace of
the holy Ghoſt, which copiouſly and aboundantly
they powred forth into her ſoule.</p>
               <p>6. On good friday in the morning, hauing ſpent
a good part therof and of the night, like another
Magdalen, in teares and tender feelings, caſt at the
feet of Chriſt contemplanting that which his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie
had ſuffered that day, he appeared vnto her
crucified, with all the enſignes of his holy Paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
&amp; the three Maries much grieued and ſadd: The
holy Damſell was ſo ſadd with the feeling and
griefe which this ſouereigne viſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cauſed her (the
which ſhee enioyed not being rapt, but in her
proper ſenſes) that of the great feeling ſhee had,
and the much that ſhee wept, ſhe left the place
where ſhee was all watered, &amp; her face remained
ſo pale and disfigured, that when her vncles came
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:15857:22"/>
from Church, amazed at the ſoddaine change
which they ſawe in their neece, they procured
that ſhee ſhould eate ſomething. But the diſeaſe
of the bleſſed Damſell not being that which her
vncles thought, ſhe herſelf comforted them, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
them not to take care, nor to oblige her to
breake the faſt of good friday, for ſhee ſhold bee
very ſoone well.</p>
               <p>7. Another night, there arriuing certaine
gentlemen at her vncles houſe, after ſhee had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
them their ſupper and conuerſed with them,
and with all thoſe of the howſe, ſhee went
out into the court alone, ſeeking ſome ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
for her exercices. Then ſet on her knees,
and being in very profound prayer, ſhe ſawe
heauen open it ſelf, and from thence deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the Queene of Angells, with her moſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Sonne in her armes, who comming neere
vnto her, looked vpon her with eyes very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous
and milde: and conſidering how neere
her ſhee had God, and his moſt holy Mother,
with moſt deuote words ſhe beſought her, that
ſhe wold fauour her, and helpe her with her
moſt Noble Sonne, in that which ſhee ſo
much deſired, which was, to be religious:
and this ſhe vttered with ſuch feruor of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,
that at the cries ſhee gaue, they went
out into the court to ſee what it was, and they
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:15857:23"/>
found her ſett with her hands &amp; knees, vpon the
ground, ſpeaking to our B. Ladie. And after being
well certified thereof, and the viſion ended, they
came all vnto her and ſpake to her diſſemblingly,
of which the virgin receiued great trouble, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
leaſt hence that ſhold be diſcouered, which
ſhee ſo much ſought to couer.</p>
               <p>8. Being thus buſied in the exerciſes aforſaid,
&amp; daylie encreaſing in virtue, as well as in yeares,
ſhee came to be 14. yeares old, at which time her
father &amp; kinsfolks bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne to treat of her remedie
(for that name the world giueth to the mariages
of women, as if there were no other remedie left
by God for them.) And at the fame of her great
retiredneſſe, honeſtie and beautie (which in that
age ſo greatly pleaſeth) ſhee was ſought of many
in marriage: among which he that was moſt of
note, was a noble yong man, borne in Illeſcas;
but wheras the intents of the bleſſed Damſell
were to haue for eſpouſe Ieſus Chriſt our Lord,
&amp; to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecrate to him her virginitie perpetually,
of this only ſhee treated, and with ſuch teares
demanded it, as ſhee deſerued to be heard of
God, and her petition alſo diſpatched, as we ſhall

purpoſes doe little profite. But being theſe of
this ſolicitous virgin were no ſuch, but ſtrong &amp;
feruorous, ſhee reſolued that as ſoone as eaſter
ſhould be paſſed, to goe to the happie monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
two leagues from her towne (and as ſhe
imagined it, ſo ſhe did it, not as a weake woman,
but as a ſtrong and forcible man, putting herſelf
into the garments of one of her cozins, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a pack of her owne) in the habit of a man; &amp;
ſo with a ſword vnder her arme, alone, and on
foote ſhee tooke her way one morning before the
riſing of the ſunne, with contradiction enough
of the diuell, who deſiring to hinder her, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
vnto her many feares &amp; aſtoniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the diſpleaſure of her Father &amp; kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
who wold conceiue amiſſe of her going in
that habit, ſo vndecent for her perſon &amp; age. This
made ſuch an impreſſion in the holy Damſell, that
beginning the way, ſhe beganne to tremble, vntill
combated by weakeneſſe and feare, all her body
tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bling, ſhe fell on the ground much diſmayed,
where ſhe heard thrice a voice, which ſaid vnto
her: Take courage, be not diſmayd, make an end
of the good worck begunne, for God will fauour
thee. Shee did not then ſee who ſpake to her,
vntill going on, ſhee knew that it was her Angell
Gardian.</p>
               <p>3. With this fauour, the holy virgin was
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:15857:25"/>
much cheered, and proſecuted her way: &amp; hauing
gone a good part of it, ſhe perceiued that there
came after her (although a far off) a perſon on
horsback: who coming more neere, ſhee knew it
was the gentleman that pretended to haue her
for his wife. She was much troubled when ſhe
ſawe him, conſidering herſelf to be alone, and in
that place, but our Lord who wold keep her, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
him not to know her, and ſhe ſeing her
ſelf free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that perill, kneeling vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ground,
gaue many thancks to God, and to his moſt holy
mother, who appeared to her, and ſayde: My
daughter take courage, for I pray for thee, and I
haue asked thee of my deare Sonne, to the end
thou reſtore my howſe of the Croſſe. With theſe
and other words of much loue, which our B.
Ladie ſpake vnto her, ſhe reſted much conforted,
and proſecuting her way, ſhe came to the holy
monaſterie, where hauing made her prayer in the
habit of a man, as ſhee went and adored the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
image of the mother of God, ſhee turned aſide
to a corner of the church, and putting off that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell,
put on the womans apparell which ſhe
brought with her, and lifting vp her eyes to an
image of our B. Ladie of much deuotion, which
ſtood ouer the regular dore of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uent (which
as is ſaid was the ſame which is there now) and
kneeling befor it, gaue thankes to her anew for
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:15857:25"/>
hauing deliuered her from ſo many dangers, and
brought her to her holy howſe. The image
ſpake vnto her, and ſaide: my daughter in good
time bee thow come to my howſe, enter merrily,
for well thow maieſt, when for the ſame God
created thee, and I againe giue thee the ſuperio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
and care ouer it, with authoritie that thou
edifie and plant virtues, and root out and deſtroy
vices and ſinnes. To this the innocent Damſell
replyed ſaying: Ah Ladie, being I come alone &amp;
in this ſort, I feare they will not receiue me your
ſeruant. Feare nothing, ſaid the holy image, for
my deare Sonne who hath brought thee hither,
will cauſe that they receiue thee.</p>
               <p>3. With this the virgin comforted in our
Lord, ſpake vnto the Abbeſſe, and giuing her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coumpt
who ſhe was, and what ſhee would,
demanded that they wold receiue her into their
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie, which for to enioy, ſhe had left her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and kinred, and to take that holy habitt, had
come in the habitt of a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſo not to be knowen.
The Abbeſſe reprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded her for hauing put her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in ſo manifeſt perill, although interiorly ſhe
gaue many thancks to God, who had infuſed ſuch
ſpirit and fortitude in to ſo tender a Damſell: &amp;
ſhe was ſo affected to her, ſeeing her ſo faire,
of ſo comely a grace, ſo well ſpoken, and ſo
compoſed, that ſhee called other religious,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:15857:26"/>
and giuing them notice of the ſucceſſe, ſayd that
the mayden was an Angell in face, in her diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and ſpirite, and that without doubt God had
brought her to the howſe, for ſome great good, &amp;
for the reparation of the conuent. The nunnes
asked her a thouſand things, &amp; with baſhfulneſſe
enough vnto herſelf, ſhee muſt againe and againe
relate all her former hiſtories.</p>
               <p>4. As ſhee was recounting theſe things,
her Father arriued with her kinsfolks, who came
to ſeeke her? What haſt thou done daughter?
ſaid hee? what madneſſe is this? what deſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
partes are theſe of thyne? ſuch like words
he ſpake vnto her, ſo grieuous and ſo foule, as
they could not be worſe, had he found her in
ſome fault of a looſe woman. To all which
ſhe made herſelf deafe, to iniuries dumbe, and to
the fierceneſſe of her Father, a ſheep. But when
ſhee heard that he wold force her to returne
vnto his howſe, with much humilitie (her
eyes becoming fontaines of teares) and ſetting
vpon her knees before his feet, ſhee beſought
him, and her vncles, that they wold moleſt her no
more, nor wearie themſelues in perſwading her
any other thing: for more eaſie it ſhold bee, to
moue the mountaines, and ſoften the rockes,
then to goe againſt the firmneſſe of her purpoſe,
for that now ſhee was vnder the ayde and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:15857:26"/>
of our B. Ladie, with great confidence
not to goe out of her howſe in all her life: and
therfore ſhe beſought them they wold not aſſay
to drawe her from thence, becauſe our Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
for whom ſhe had come, would defend her.</p>
               <p>5. By this time alſo was the yong man come
who had mett her in the way, and prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
with her: he was driuen to great extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
when hee knew of her abſence, ſeeking her
in many places, and with licence of her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and kinsfolke, he offered to carrie her to
Illeſcas, and keepe her with his mother daintilie
and well attended on, vntill ſuch time as all
things ſhold be well compoſed. The ſeruant of
our Lord with great humilitie and integritie, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
theſe ſpeaches, &amp; obteined of her kinsfolk,
that they ſhold leaue her in that monaſterie of
our B. Ladie, whither interiorly the holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
had called her. The religious ſeeing theſe
thinges, and the great deuotion and perſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of the moſt humble and deuout Damſell,
had compaſſion of her in ſuch ſorte, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoug
they were very poore, they ſaid they wold
haue no more riches, then to haue ſuch a pledge
from heauen in their houſe, and that they wold
receiue her ether with little, or without any dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
at all, as her Father was beſt able: who ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
appeaſed, and touched with the powerfull
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:15857:27"/>
hand of God ſaid: God forbid my daughter, that
we ſhold goe againſt the will of him, from whom

which thou haſt had well declareth, and this

a perſon of ſuch ſpirite. The prouincial ſawe

her, and ſatisfied with her deuotion, and the
teares where with ſhee demanded the habit,
comanded it ſhold be giuen her, and went his
way. And ſo ſhee was admitted into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent
and receiued the habit on the third of May,
the day of the inuention of the holy Croſſe,
when ſhe had accompliſhed 15. yeares, the yeare
of our Lord 1496. her Father and kinsfolk being
preſent.</p>
               <p>2. As ſoone as the holy virgin ſawe herſelf
religious, conſidering the obligation of the newe

of the nouices commanded her by and by,
that in all the yeare of her nouitiate ſhe ſhould
not ſpeake, but with her, or the Abbeſſe, or
Vicareſſe, or with her Confeſſor: of which the
nouice was very glad, for naturally ſhee was
inclined to ſpeake little: and ſo ſhe kept it ſo
punctually all the yeare of her nouice ſhip, and
all the things which ſhee was taught, with ſuch
exactnes, that ſhe wold ſooner yeld to be killed,
then to breake only one, howe little ſoeuer the

God, that not only ſhee obſerued all things which

it. Concerning which there hapned to her ſome
caſes of great edification, ſuppoſing her ſinceritie,
which are not related, becauſe they are not ſo
imitable.</p>
               <p>3. The firſt time that the bleſſed nouice com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
with the other nunnes, a thing happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to her of great noueltie, and diſcomfort:
for our Lord ſo permitting it, ſhee did not then
ſee in the conſecrated hoſte, that which alwayes
ſhee was wont to ſee which was, Chriſt our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour,
as hath beene ſayde. Wherat ſhe remained
ſo afflicted and diſconforted, that her eyes caſting
forth fountaines of teares, ſhe went to giue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
to the confeſſor, of her new diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort; &amp;
ſo extreme, as it draue her into great ſtraites, and
no little care of ſeeking reaſons therof to comfort
herſelfe with all. What Father (quoth ſhe)
Doth not this deſerue hell? Is it not enough (ſaid
this innocent ſoule) to condemne me? this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of God muſt needs be great: why, it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
me for my ſinnes, what is graunted to all
Chriſtians? The prudent co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſor comforted her,
ſaying, that although ſhee had not ſeene Chriſt
our Lord in the conſecrated hoſte, ſhe ſhold not
thinck that ſhe had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated in mortall ſinne,
nor that the fauours which God had done her at
other times, were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated to all: for although
the change of the bread into the fleſh of Chriſt, is
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:15857:28"/>
reall and true, yet it is not alwayes ſeene with
corporall eyes, but with thoſe of the ſoule:
wherby the faith is very meritorious of thoſe
who come to this moſt holy Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, beleeuing
truly that Chriſt our redeemer, whom they ſee
not, is vnder thoſe accidents. With theſe and
other reaſons which he ſpake vnto her, the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
nouice remained much comforted, and gaue
great thancks to God for ſo ſingular fauours, as
he had done her vntil then, with the preſence of
her moſt ſweet redeemer, whom ſo often ſhe had
ſeene in the Sacrament of the Altar, and for that
which then he did vnto her, in exercizing of her
faith.</p>
               <p>4. The bleſſed Nouice, accompliſhed the
yeare of her probation, and with the voices of all
the conuent, ſhe was admitted to be profeſſed,
which ſhe made with much ſeruour and teares,
on the day of the holy Croſſe, the third of May:
for the which, and for hauing taken the habitt on
the ſame day, ſhee tooke her ſurname of the
Croſſe: ſo truly to follow Chriſt crucified, as her
life from that time forward was a Croſſe, ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
to the diuell, that not being able to endure
it, he who with helliſhe furie, threwe downe the
firſt man from the height in which God had crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him, that a woman yong &amp; weak, ſhould now
ouercome him &amp; eſcape free out of his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds (God
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:15857:29"/>
permitting it, to exerciſe his ſeruant, as another
Iob or S. Antonie, in patience) he perſecuted
her viſiblie and inuiſible, and the diuell tempted
her in a thouſand manners, many times whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
her ſo rigorouſly and ſo cruelly, that the
ſtripes and markes of the ſtrokes and blowes
which he gaue her, dured on her for many dayes,
and newe woundes added, before the old were
wholly healed.</p>
               <p>5. One time it chanced to her, that asking
humbly of God for a ſoule, the diuells whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
her ſo cruelly, and ſhed ſo much bloud
forth of her body, that they left her for
dead. At that time came her Angell keeper,
and cheering herſelfe with his preſence, ſhee
ſaide vnto him with great loue: O bleſſed An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
what haue you done? how haue you left me
in ſo great neceſſitie and wearineſſe, looke how
the miniſters of the diuine iuſtice haue handled
me. To which the Angell anſweared very ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full:
nether haue I left thee, nor doth my Lord
Ieſus Chriſt leaue thee: but I tell thee in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half,
that with this euill entreatie, theſe blowes,
and ſtripes which they haue giuen thee, thou haſt
gained a crowne very gratefull to the diuine ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie:
and I come in virtue of his name to cure
thee of theſe woundes. And making vpon her
the ſigne of the Croſſe, he healed her, and our
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:15857:29"/>
Lord granted her that which ſhe asked, for that

               <p>1 THe newe Profeſſed, found herſelf ſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged
to God, for hauing brought her to
holy religion, and ſo deſirous to doe him great
ſeruice, that from the day ſhee was profeſſed, ſhe
determined to ſuffer for his loue whatſoeuer kind
of torment was compatible with her condition,
deſiring to giue her life for that Lord, who with
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:15857:30"/>
ſo much loue gaue his life for her. And many
times thinking on this loue of her God, with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to be a martyr, ſhee ſayd with great grief: O
that God would doe me this fauour, that I might
dy for him, for I deſier no other bleſſednes on the
earth, then to ſee my ſelfe beheaded, for his loue,
burned, beaten to poulder, or ſcalded to death.
Thincking on this, and on her moſt ſweet eſpouſe
crucified for her, burning in his loue, ſhee ſayde:
Lord giue me paines, torments, labours, and
griefs: command the Angells of heauen, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uells
of hell, and all the creatures of the earth,
to execute vpon me all their power, for be it
as great as it can be, it ſhall be all limited and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,

maieſtie I deſire to ſuffer, my only loue, and
my good, through thy diuine grace.</p>
               <p>2. Accompanying with worckes theſe ſo
feruorous deſires, ſhee beganne to lead a newe
life, and to doe very ſharp penances, adding to
the old ones ſome newe, and to her great rigours,
others very terrible. And her faſtes were ſuch,
as ſhe brake them not in three dayes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and often times ſhe paſſed eight whole
dayes without eating one bitt. Her watching was
very long, and her ſleep ſo little, that ſhee ſlept
not vntill the day break, &amp; then only that which
ſerued to comfort the head. Her clothing was

alwayes more humble, poore, and patched, then
of any other of the nunnes, but without any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie

herſelf in humble offices, and with notable
charitie to ſerue the ſicke religious, wholly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
for their ſeruice and comforte: in which
there happened to her things of great mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
much like to thoſe which haue happened to
diuers other ſaints, who licked the wounds of the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:15857:31"/>
ſick, and exerciſed themſelues in offices which
of their oune nature were very loathſome, but to
God very pleaſing, as with his diuine fauour ſhee
his douote ſeruant did many times, who being
Cooke, and drawing water out of the well,
brake a great panne of clay which ſhee carried
in her hands, for the which ſhee was much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded:
and attributing it to her ſlouth and
careleſneſſe, ſhe threw herſelfe downe vpon the
earth, and making prayer to our Lord, the pieces
were ioyned together, and the panne remaining
whole, ſerued afterward two or three yeares
in the kitchin. One religious who was preſent
at all this, and ſawe with her eyes the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
ſayde: what is this ſiſter? was not this
panne all to peeces? how is it now whole? to
this the bleſſed cooke anſwered with much hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie:
yes ſiſter, but our Lord hath remedied
by his goodneſſe, that which I haue abuſed by
my ſinnes.</p>
               <p>4. In ſuch exerciſes as this, and the like, the
ſeruant of God ſpent her time, and the firſt
yeares of her religion, which being ſo admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
and the great talent and valour of the
newe profeſſed, and her prudence, and ſanctitie
being knowen (although her yeares were but
fewe) obedience employed her in the office
of ſacriſtian, after hauing been well prooued in
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:15857:31"/>
that of the kitchen; of the which ſhe gaue ſo
good account, that without taking her from it,
they gaue her alſo care of the Torner, and ſhee
proued ſo well in theſe offices, that in ſhort
time they made her Portreſſe. All which in that
ſhee did them with ſo much humilitie and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
(as moſt zealous of the ſeruice of God,
of ſanctitie, and of the ſeruice of the conuent)
ſhe did vndergoe great labours: for becauſe
ſhee was yong, all oppoſed themſelues againſt
her, and the moſt mild lambe humbled herſelf
to whom ſoeuer, and to thoſe that chi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in ſeruing of the other religious, in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
of humilitie and obedience, as if therin
had been her glory, her bliſſe, and her heauen.
And intruth ſo it was, for in theſe offices ſhee
found God, who is the bliſſe and true hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen

the porterie, and in the torner: for doing theſe
offices ſhee went ſo enamored of her moſt ſweet
Ieſus, that alwayes ſhee had him preſent, in ſo
much that if ſhee turned the torner to giue or
receiue any thing, thorough the ſame, ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated
the cradell in which ſhe rocked the

very peaceable &amp; ſmiling, ſpake vnto her,
making merry with her.</p>
               <p>5. Another time being Portreſſe, the moſt
holy child Ieſus appeared to her, and as ſoone as
ſhe ſawe him, ſhe ſtretched out her armes for to
embrace him: but at the ſame inſtant appeared
his moſt holy mother, &amp; taking him in her armes,
lifted her ſelf vpon highe with him, accompanied
with infinite Angells, who with moſt ſweet har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
made him muſick. But as ſoone as bleſſed
Ioane ſawe that the mother &amp; the Sonne depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and left her ſo alone, iudgeing her ſelfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie
of ſo ſoueraigne companie, ſhe remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
very ſadd, and without comfort: but ſhe that
is mother of comfort, comforting her, ſayde: Do
not afflict thy ſelfe daughter, but come toward
the figtrees in the garden, for there thou ſhalt
find vs.</p>
               <p>6. Moſt contented with this fauour, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing
her office of obedience, ſhee went to the
garden looking on euery ſide, to ſee that which
her ſoule deſired: and approaching to the bake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>howſe
neer vnto the figtrees, ſhe ſawe our Lord
Ieſus Chriſt, and his bleſſed mother, and many
Angells which awayted her. And falling proſtrate
vpon the earth, ſhee adored God, and the B. vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:15857:32"/>
and ſtood long time enioying of that ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
viſion, ſo abſorpt, as although they called
her with a bell, ſhe heard not, vntill the mother
of God ſaid to her: Goe daughter, performe thy
obedience, for they haue called thee three ſeuerall
times, and thou haſt neuer heard them. Then lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
God, and his mother, for obedience ſake,
ſhee went to ſee who it was that ſought her: and
hauing done the buſineſſe, ſhe returned by &amp; by
to the bake-howſe aforeſaid, where ſhe had left
her hart and her reſt. But ſome of the nonnes mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
her, noted much the ſpeed and haſt with
which ſhe went, &amp; that her face was very bright,
and that a ſweet ſauour proceeded from it: for the
which ſome of them followed her, deſirous to
know, what the matter was, ſuſpecting ſome
great thing. And ſeeing her enter into the bake
howſe, they heard her ſay: O ſoueraigne mother
of God, great is thy mercy towards me vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
ſinner, that I hauing gone, and left thee and
my moſt ſweet eſpouſe in this humble and poore
place, I find that you ar ſtil here attending for me.
The nonnes alſo heard the B. virgin anſweare,
ſaying. My daughter, thou haſt therfore found
me, becauſe for obedience ſake thou haſt left me,
which much pleaſeth my Sonne and me.</p>
               <p>7. The bleſſed Ioane was ſo fauoured of our
B. Ladie the virgin, as the fauours and comforts
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:15857:33"/>
which ſhe receiued from her powerfull hand,
cannot as they worthilie deſerue, be eſteemed.
For not only being a child, but when ſhe was
of greater age, and in all times, ſhe had great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelations
and viſites of our Lord, and of his moſt
holy mother, both in r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ptes and out of them,
which dured her more or leſſe time, as pleaſed
God. At the beginning, three, or foure howres:
after they were greater, for they came to four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen,
and to twenty, and forty houres euery one,
&amp; ſometimes ſhe was eleuated, three dayes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
returning to herſelf; Once it happened her to
returne from a very great rapt, and ſcarcely to
haue come to her ſelfe, when only hearing
named the moſt ſweete name of Ieſus, or of
ſeing ſome image of his moſt ſacred paſſion,
ſhee was againe eleuated as before, without
any manner of ſenſe or feeling. She was moſt
beautifull and ſhining in theſe rapts, and when
ſhe returned from them, the nonnes beſought,
her, that ſhee would tell where ſhee was, and
what ſhee had ſeen in thoſe rapt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which although ſhe refuſed to doe (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing
her ſelfe for humilitie ſake) yet when it
was the will of God that ſhee ſhold manifeſt
it, ſhee ſayde, that her good Angell carried
her in ſpirite, and ſet her in a throne very bright
and glorious, where ſhe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

moſt holy mother, and the Angells, the Apoſtles,
and Euangeliſtes, the Patriarches, and Prophets,
our holy Father ſaint Francis, and infinite other
ſaints, men, and women of the newe and old te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,
giuing ſuch euident ſignes of them, as if
ſhe had beene borne and brought vp with them.
She ſaid that they went adorned with their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
inſignes. The ſaints of the old teſtament
with the figures therof which they repreſented,
conforme to their prophecies, Abraham with
the ſacrifice of the lamb, Moyſes with his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
and the buſh: Aaron with his rodd: others
with the Arck of the teſtament. And that the
ſaints of the newe teſtament, carried alſo their
enſignes. The Apoſtles and Martyrs thoſe of their
martyrdome, our holy Father, S. Francis, the fiue
wounds more bright then ſtarres: others carried
the chalice with the moſt holy Sacrament, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
the font of baptiſme, and others the keyes
of the Church: Euery one of them more faire
and bright, and more ſhining then the ſunne: in
ſo much that it is a meruellous thinge and very
pleaſing, to ſee and contemplate theſe things,
full of ſo much beautie and comlineſſe, as no
tongue is able to explicate the ſame, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to that which our Lord of his mercy doth
ſhew them vnto me (ſaid the Saint) and will
that I ſee them from that holy place, where as
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:15857:34"/>
it ſeemeth to me, I ſtand tyed with a certaine
beame of that place, which denoteth, that my
ſoule is not yet wholly vntied and free, from the
priſon of this body.</p>
               <p>8. The bleſſed Ioane was foure and twentie
yeares ould, at which age, the no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes ſaw her fall
into a rapt, ſuch, as neither before, nor after, ſhe
neuer was ſeene to haue the like: For other times
when ſhee was rapt, ſhe remained with much
beautie and luſtre of her face: but this time it
was not ſo, for all that, wanted in her, and ſhe
remained as one dead, her eyes broken &amp; ſunck,
her lippes blue, her teeth gnaſhing, her noſe
drawen vp, and all the members of her body diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioynted
and ſtiffe, and her face ſo pale and wanne,
as if ſhe were altogether dead. The nonnes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
at the noueltie of the chance, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to know the cauſe therof, prayed the holy
virgin, that ſhee wold reueale the ſame vnto
them. But ſhee as one prudent and ſilent, wold
neuer tell it, vntill ſome dayes being paſſed, her
good Angell commanded her to tell it, and then
ſhee ſayde: the cauſe (mothers) that you ſawe
in me ſuch noueltie in that rapt, was, for that
being in it, I ſawe my good Angell with ſad

ſayde, that our Lord had ſhewed him the great

prayed for me,<note place="margin">The Angells to shew ſad countenance and to weep, is a ſpeach which the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſcripture vſeth, as in the 33. chapter of Iſaias more by ſimilitude, then by propriet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

him, that for

might not endure that

and the moſt powerfull

And ſo from that day
all her rapts were very
ſweet, being ſo great &amp;
ſo long, that the moſt
of the day and of the
night, ſhee was ſo ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uated,
that ſhe could not now doe any office,
nor follow the burden of the communitie as ſhee
was wont: wherfore they gaue her a cell aparte,
and one of the Religious that ſhold take care of

               <p>9. Oftentimes it happened vnto her, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring
to pleaſe her beloued eſpouſe, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
with how great crueltie he was whippt at
a pillar, deſiring to imitate him in that point,
asking firſt leaue for it of his diuine maieſtie, ſhe
ſhut her ſelfe vp in a chamber, very cloſe and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,
where ſhee was wont to do her mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and penances, and naked, ſhe tyed her ſelfe
to a pillar, which ſhe had there for theſe mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations:
then faſtning herſelf with cordes, firſt her
feet, and after her body, leauing her armes free,
ſhee whipped her ſelfe all ouer with a chayne of
iron; and that the chayne might the better diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
its office, ſhe hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g at the end of it a ball of
iron round and maſſiue, and taking it in her hand,
ſhe ſtrook her ſelfe with the ends of the chayne
ouer all the body, vntill ſhe ſhed bloud. Being in
this holy exerciſe, contemplating the ſtripes of
our Sauiour, and bruſing her fleſh with thoſe ſhe
gaue her ſelfe, her good Angell appeared to her,
and commanded her to ceaſe, ſaying: enough, for
hitherto extendeth the will of my Lord Ieſus
Chriſt; and the ſame Angell, vntied her ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
from the pillar at which ſhee ſtood.</p>
               <p>10. Other times with the deſire ſhe had to
pleaſe God, kneeling on her knees in that little
chamber, ſhe tooke a flint, which weighed ſeaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:15857:37"/>
pounds, and with ſo great feruour ſhee ſtrooke
her ſelfe vpon the breaſt there with, that at the
very firſt blowe, the bloud ſprang out ſo far, that
it ſpotted the walles. Shee co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued in this holy
exerciſe as long, as ſhe was wont to bee in going
on her knees fifteen times about the chamber, in
memorie of the fifteen principall woundes of
our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>11. One night the ſaint finding her ſelfe much
afflicted, and euilly treated of the diuells, which
with filthie and vnſeemly figures, pretended to
induce her to ſenſuall deſires, ſhee went out
into the garden, and gathering together ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
buſhes, in imitation of our holy Father
ſaint Francis, ſtripping herſelfe naked, ſhe layd
herſelf downe vpon that thornie bed, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

into a lake, ſaying; That thou mayeſt
knowe that thou art clay, in this mudd thou
ſhalt waſh thy ſelfe, and yet thou doeſt not
deſerue this. There ſhee ſtood a great while,
and before ſhee put on her cloathes againe,
ſhee whipped herſelfe with a chayne, which
ſhe had made to this effect: after which time
ſhe remained ſo fauored of almightie God,
that neuer after did the enemie ſet vpon her
with ſuch like temptations.</p>
               <p>12. With the great ſpirite and deuotion
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:15857:38"/>
which this bleſſed one had, ſhe made a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
inuentions for mortification and penance,
ſometimes ſhe girded her armes, and her body
with ropes of briſſels and of hard ruſhes, in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie
of the ropes wher with our Sauiour was
faſtned to the pillar. Other times ſhe girded her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
with the chaynes, with which before ſhe
had whipped herſelf. And for the moſt parte ſhe
went alwayes veſted with iron, as the hard

another of plates of iron in forme of a hart, which
girded her body on euery ſide, and for her more

that bowing herſelf with it, the pointes of the
nailes entred into her body, ſhe offering all to
our Sauiour in memorie of his ſacred paſſion. And
for her greater mortification, ſhe was wont to

a rope which ſhe put about her neck, and whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping

little ſtones, or tile ſhardes, which did greatly
wound her. Other times ſhee ſet herſelf croſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe

Sacrament as oft as ſhe could: which when it was

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:15857:40"/>

and what mercy, and liberalitie is that which
thy diuine maieſtie beſtoweth vpon an vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
&amp; miſerable ſlaue? This ſaid the holy Ioane,
giuing thancks to God for communicating ſo
often ſpirituallie: and touching Sacramentall
Communion, ſuch meruailous things happened
vnto her, as theſe following do declare.</p>
               <p>3. This moſt deuote virgin on a time confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
her ſelfe while the conuentuall maſſe was
ſayde, the confeſſor bidd her goe and adore the
moſt holy Sacrament, and comming to a portall
hard by the Church, hearing it ring to the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,
ſhe kneeled on her knees to adore from
thence with the eyes of her ſoule, him whom
ſhe could not ſee with the eyes of her body.
Being ſo on her knees, the wall of the portall
which diuided the conuent from the Church,
was opened a wide, and ſhee ſawe the moſt holy
Sacrament on the altar, as alſo the prieſt who
ſaid maſſe, and all the Church, &amp; perſons which
were therein. And hauing adored the ſacred Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſte
and Chalice, the wall ioyned it ſelfe againe
together, ſhe remayning on her knees in the ſame
place: but when the prieſt eleuated the Hoſte
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:15857:41"/>
the latter time, the wall opened againe. And
for a perpetuall memorie of this miracle, our
Lord God would, that the laſt ſtone in which
the ioynt of the wall ſhut it ſelfe, ſhold remayne
more white then the others, and clouen in three
partes in manner of a Croſſe, as is to be ſeene to
this very day, and from that time hath beene
held in great veneratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And when that wall was
taken downe, for to make the Church in the
forme that now it is, the moſt part of this ſtone,
(as a pretious relique) was put in the high cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
as now it ſtandeth, couered with a grate of
iron guilded, whither the nonnes repaire to pray
and to touch their beades.</p>
               <p>4. The like to this happened to the humble
ſeruant of God, as ſhe went about the worke
of the kitchen, for hearing it ring to the eleua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
amongſt the firebrands and the pots where
as ſhe was, ſhe kneeled vpon her knees, and there
adored: and it ſeemed to her that ſhe ſawe the
moſt holy Sacrament, although there were foure
or fiue ſeuerall walles, and as many chambers
between it &amp; her. And one time Chriſt our Lord
ſpake to her in the conſecrated hoſte, promiſing
her the ſaluation of a nonne of her co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uent, which
was in the very agonie of death, for whom ſhee
prayed. Being one Eaſter eue in her cell, ſhe
heard it ring to the <hi>Gloria,</hi> and being not able
to goe to maſſe, becauſe ſhe was ſick, kneeling
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:15857:41"/>
on her knees in the bed to giue thancks to God,
ſhe ſawe from thence, and heard all that which
the prieſt ſayd at the Altar, and that which the
nonnes did ſay in the quire; And which is more,
ſhee ſawe Chriſt riſen, bright, and glorious as he
came out of the ſepulchre, with many Angells
which made him muſick and ſong many hymnes.
Other times it happened to this virgin (ſo tende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of God) that being farr fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the quire, ſhe heard
the diuine office which the nonnes ſaid, &amp; by the
ſignes which ſhe gaue ſo punctually of all things
done, the miracle was appare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; the truth therof.</p>
               <p>5. One of the Religious ſeeking another thing
in the cell of this holy virgin, ſawe within a little
coffer, a conſecrated hoſte, our Lord permitting
it, who by this meanes would publiſh ſo ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
a miracle. At the ſame inſtant the ſeruant
of God returned from a rapt in which ſhe was,
and with great anxietie went ſtreight to the little
coffer wherin the religious went to looke, to
whom ſhe ſayde: ſiſter do not touch this holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,
for it is the moſt holy Sacrament, which
the Angells haue brought hither. The religious
aſtoniſhed to heare her ſay ſo, prayed her ſhe
wold tel the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> how it came thither; to whom ſhe
ſaide: A certaine man (who for his ſinnes went to
hell) dyed with the moſt holy Sacrament in his
mouth, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the Angells tooke it with great
reuerence, and brought it hither, commanding
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:15857:42"/>
me that being I had ſeene it, I ſhold communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
that holy Hoaſte, and receiue it for one of
the ſoules in purgatorie: and being in prayer they
ſaid vnto me, that a certain perſon came to the
coffer where the holy Hoſte was, and ſo I will
forth with performe my obedience, and that
which the Angells command me, and receiue
my Lord: and ſo kneeling on her knees, with
many teares and much deuotion, ſhe receiued
the moſt holy Sacrament, her Angell admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring
it vnto her.</p>

                  </gap>awe her

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:15857:43"/>
the fact, as deſirous to knowe it, prayed her to
recount it to them, and ſhee for their edification
ſayde vnto them. Becauſe you buſied your ſelues
in thinking on me, when you ſhold haue treated
only with God, his diuine maieſtie wold that his
Angells ſhold carry me on highe, from whence
they and I adored the moſt holy Sacrament, and
I ſawe you all communicate, &amp; how much your
Angells keepers reioyſed themſelues with thoſe
who communicated holily and purely: and how
they turned their faces and departed a little way
from thoſe, who did not communicate with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
deuotion. Wherfore ſhee perſwaded the
nonnes they ſhold be very deuote to their good
Angells, becauſe they not only keepe vs alwayes,
and acompanie vs, but alſo when we fall, they
take vs vp: and if we be cold in deuotion, they
inflame vs. They are thoſe that teach vs in our

our labours, and at the houre of our death with
particular vigilancie, doe aſſiſt, &amp; acompanie our
ſoules, and preſent them to God, they viſit them
and comfort them in purgatorie. Finally in our
laboures and perills, they ayde, and defend vs.
And that you may know how certaine this is (ſaid
the holy Ioane to her nonnes) this other day I
ſawe the mother vicareſſe ringing the bell of the
communitie that the religious might come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:15857:43"/>
being they did not all forthwith repaire
thither, the Angell keepers of thoſe which were
wanting, came to do the obedience for them.</p>
               <p>3. Another time this holy virgin being Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſſe,
reprehending two yong religious in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of the others, ſhe ſayd vnto them. A little
while ſince, I being in prayer, our Lord ſhewed
me your diſobedience, and that you would not
ſweepe that which the mother vicareſſe, had
commanded you: for the which you loſt two
crownes which your good Angells brought for
you, and God comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding them, they gaue them
to the good Angells of two other ſiſters, that
they might put them on them, becauſe they had
obeyed for you. This God ſhewed to me, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,

do ſo much feare him, that ſometime with only

               <p>6. She demanded on a time of her holy
Angel, why it was that the Angells were ſo faire,
and ſo bleſſed, and the diuells, ſo deformed, and
ſo obſtinate in their ſinne. Thou haſt demanded
many things, ſaid her good Angell: to all which
I will make thee anſweare, becauſe God will
haue it ſo. Then he declared to the Saint, ſuch

of almoſt all queſtions &amp; ſubtilities which ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſticall

which is written of them, aſwell of the manner
of theire creation, confirmation in grace, and the
diſpoſition they had to merite the ſame, and in
what time they obtained their beatitude: as of
the fall of the diuells, their ſinne and obſtinacie,
and after what manner they were caſt from
heauen: with other difficulties of the like nature,
which are more to exerciſe wittes in the ſchooles,

prayed him to do it, whom he then commanded
to write theſe things, and many other which
our Lord did reueale vnto her, as wee read them
in the bookes of her ſpeaches, which are full of
maruailous things. The B. Ioane beſought her
Angell, to tell her the iuſt number of times our
Lady had appeared in that place. Who told her,
that nine times arewe the virgin our B. Lady had
appeared in that holy houſe, on the firſt nine
dayes of the month of March, and that at the
laſt of theſe apparitions, our Lady ſet the Croſſe,
ſigning therwith the place where ſhee wold haue
them build the Church, which is in the middeſt
of the chancell, in the ſame place where nowe
ſtandeth a Croſſe, in memorie of that which the
ſoueraigne Queene of heauen ſett there with her

               <p>7. The B. S. Ioane had ſuch terrible perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions
&amp; infirmities, as heerafter we ſhal ſhew,
and ſo little humane comfort in them, that ſhe
knewe not to whom ſhe might turne her ſelfe,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:15857:46"/>
but to her good Angell, to whom with much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliaritie
&amp; plaines, ſhe recounted her trauailes,
and layd open the ſcruples of her conſcience.
One day when the furie of her perſecutions and
affrontes were at the height, ſhee told him it
wold be a great comfort to her, if he wold heare
her confeſſion. I haue not ſo much authoritie,
ſaid the Angell, nor is it my office, but the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice

the earth, that he can abſolue and pardon ſinnes.

To this ſhee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed:
ſir, among thoſe
tentations which moſt
do afflict me, I hold it
for a great tentation,
that it ſeemeth to me I doe feele to much the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:15857:47"/>
falſe teſtimonies that are raiſed againſt me, &amp; it
giueth me great trouble, becauſe I knowe not if
there be in it any vaine glory or pride. There is
none in this, ſaid the Angell, but rather it is iuſt
that thou feele the loſſe of thy fame, &amp; of thy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
at leaſt for that of God, whom they offend
who do infame thee. Ah ſir, ſaid ſhee, I thinck
now this is extreme which I haue in feeling my

I thinck vpon my ſinnes, chiefly after they haue

it. And ſaying this, ſhe ſhed many teares, for
the which her Angell deſiring to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort her, ſaid.</p>
               <p>9. Be quiet bleſſed ſoule, let not the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie
of thy ſinnes ſo much torment thee, nor
let thy tribulations wearie thee, when for them
thou ſhalt bee bleſſed, and they purifie thee as the
fornace doth the gold. Neither do thou thinck,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:15857:47"/>
that becauſe thou art reprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded by thy prelates,
that they do abhorre thee, but that by this way
thy crowne ſhall be made, and thy ſoule ſhall be
purified: for as the holy ſcripture ſaith, thou haſt
it alwayes in the palme of thy hands. I wold not
ſir that my ſoule ſhould be in ſuch wicked hands
as mine are (replyed ſhee) but only in the handes
of God, for ſo I ſhold haue it moſt ſecure, for I
being ſo euill, &amp; a ſinner, do feare much to loſe it:
&amp; ſir it ſeemeth to me, that according to the great
mercies which God vſeth towards ſuch a ſinner,
our Lord would be pleaſed with me, if I did not
ſo much feele how greatly they doe afflict &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute
me, and wher I ſhould perſwade my ſelfe,
that with great reaſon they doe it, yet I cannot at
all times, for the little virtue which I haue: &amp; I
wold rather not to haue bene borne, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to haue
offended my God ſo many times. Ah holy Angell,
how great are my ſinnes? What ſhall be come of
me, if God according to his mercy do not deale
with me like himſelf? demand it thou of him (my
holy keeper) let not this ſoule bee loſt which is
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to thy charge, giue good accoumpt of
this thy little ſheepe, ſuffer not the wolfe, holy
S. Laruell, to cary her away. Bleſſed comforter
of ſoules, comfort mine, for I am altogether
without comfort and perſecuted: although the
greateſt of my perſecutions is, to thincke that
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:15857:48"/>
God permitteth them becauſe I am ſo great a
ſinner, and for this cauſe it is that the diuell,
doth ſo much torment me.</p>
               <p>10. Be not vngratefull to our Lord (ſaide the
Angell) for the perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which ar inflicted on
thee, are ſo many fauours which God doth giue
thee: and thou knoweſt well, that it is long time
ſince I told thee, that ſatan had asked licence to
perſecute thee, and to tempt thee as hee did holy
Iob. But truſt in Ieſus Chriſt our redeemer, and
in the virtue of his Croſſe, for although the body
ſuffer, yet the ſoule ſhall be ſaued. Caſt therfore
away this feare and vexation, and conſider that
if thy perſecutions be great, ſo alſo are the helpes
and ſuccours which our Lord ſendeth thee to
ſupport them, as are the many viſitations which
his diuine maieſtie, and his holy mother do ſo

               <p>11. At the fame of theſe things, and many

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:15857:49"/>
repaired vnto her ſo many people that ſtood in
neede of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſolation, that many times there were
ſeene all at once at the doore of the conuent, a

ſpake vnto moſt curreouſly, without being euer

in truth the condition of her good Angell; to
whom after their departures ſhee repreſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted the
neceſſities of them all, requeſting him to comfort
them: and ſo well ſhe retained the anſwear of her
Angell as, although they were of things very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
yet ſhe forgot none. To a certain ſpirituall
perſon who prayed her to know of her Angell,
what he ſhold do to pleaſe our Lord, ſhe anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
Peace, prayer, and ſilence are three things
which much pleaſe God. And to another who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
to knowe the ſame, ſhe ſaide. Weepe with
thoſe that weep, reioyce with thoſe that reioyce,
and hold thy peace with thoſe that ſpeake. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
perſon in neceſſitie of health and comfort,
knowing that eache one found it by her meanes,
ſent to pray her that ſhe wold obtaine of her An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
ſome holeſom councell, to beare with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
the dolours of her infirmitie, which were
great. And the holy Virgin hauing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſulted with

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:15857:49"/>
Many were the anſweres which the Angell gaue
to the ſeruant of God in diuers buſines, which
euery moment ſhe conſulted with him; all full
of miſteries, &amp; like celeſtiall oracles, moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant

               <p>12. This ſeruant of our Lord, did not only treat
with her good Angell, and with other Angells,
with the familiaritie which we haue ſeene, but
ſhee had the ſame in very great degree with many
ſaintes, in eſpeciall with the moſt glorious S. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
of Padua, of whom from her infancie ſhe was
ſo tendered and fauoured in all her laboures, that
in each occaſion he was her ſingular patrone, and
aduocate. Being one time in prayer, asking of our
Lord mercy for her owne, and for other ſoules,
the glorious Saint appeared to her, and ſaide:
Daughter, who pleaſeth her ſweeteſt eſpouſe
ſo much as thou doſt pleaſe him, may demand
much of him. And the ſaint contemplating the
beauty of that moſt ſweet childe which S. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonie
brought in his hand, beganne to ſpeake
to him ſuch louing ſpeaches, and ſo ſweet, that
ſhe ſtood ſo a great while, vntill the ſame ſaint
ſayed to her: Turne away, my daughter, thy
face, and be ſorrowefull for thy ſiſters, and for
their neceſſities. And turning her face a little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,
ſhe ſawe two ſoules in great neceſſitie: and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:15857:50"/>
with the great loue ſhe bore to the child Ieſus,
ſhee begged for them, ſaying with great humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,
and confidence: Lord I will not ariſe from
theſe thy moſt holy feet, vntill I obtaine this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour.
The which our moſt pious Lord, moued
by her clamoures and begging, did forthwith
beſtowe vpon her; And giuing thancks to his
diuine maieſtie for the pardon which he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to thoſe ſoules, ſaint Antonie ſtretching out
ouer her his hande, and giuing her his benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
ſayde: Here reſteth in his eſpouſe, diuine
Ieſus, the true eſpouſe of ſoules. This rapt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured
long time, and the ſaint returned out of
it, with ſo great mirth and ſplendor in her face,
that ſhee cauſed great admiration to all the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
which ſawe the ſame.</p>
               <p>13. Another time the B. virgin making an
end of doing a certaine worck of charitie, to the
benefit of one of the religious of the houſe, ſhe
remayned with ſome diſcomfort ſeeing her wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
of other neceſſities for her ſoule: and this griefe
encreaſing in her, becauſe the ſpirituall neceſſitie
of her ſiſter encreaſed, fetching a great ſigh, ſhee
called vpon S. Antonie, ſaying: ô my Father S.
Antonie, help me nowe, and be my interceſſor
to the diuine maieſtie, that he will deliuer this
my ſiſter. This ſhe ſaide with ſo much charitie
and loue of God, that at the ſame inſtant, the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:15857:50"/>
ſaint appeared, and ſaid to her: beloued eſpouſe
of my Lord Ieſus Chriſt, what dooſt thou aske
me? what is that thou woldeſt haue? for thou
ſhalt obtaine it of his diuine maieſtie. To the
which with moſt profound humilitie the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
woman anſwered: my Father S. Antonie, I
find my ſelfe ſo vnworthie, that I dare not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
before my moſt ſweet Ieſus, but only by
thy interceſſion. Then the glorious Father ſtrer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
out his bleſſed hand, gaue her his benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and the child Ieſus which he held in the
other hand, ſayde to her with many ſhewes of
loue: I will help thee in thy neceſſities; and that
which now thou demandeſt for thy ſiſter, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie
granted thee: who within one moneth,
ſhall paſſe out of this temporall life to the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
pardoning her many yeares of Purgatorie
by thy interceſſion, and prayers. And giuing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thancks to God for this mercy, with great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacritie
of ſpirite, ſhe went to the religious, and
bad her prepare her ſelfe, for in very ſhort time
God wold receiue her to his reſt. The ſiſter asked
her how ſoone her departure ſhold be; and ſhee
was anſwered, that within one moneth. And it
pleaſed our Lord, to giue her at that inſtant, great
contrition, and ſorrowe for her ſinnes, and within
the moneth, tooke her from hence to himſelf.</p>

much beloued of them, that they held them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
for bleſſed, in taking her benediction, kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing

which ſhe remedied, and prouided for: her An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
keeper, often telling her, what ſhe was to
doe, and to ordaine. Finallie ſhe exhorted them
all, to what was good, and reprehended that
which was not ſo, chaſtizing with much chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

were it neuer ſo little. And for to animate the
nonnes in the ſeruice of God, and better obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

the Chapter, many things of thoſe which our
Lord of his mercy ſhewed vnto her.</p>

her feare, full of charitie and confidence, ſaid:

full of charitie and confidence, ſaid: Daughter do

created thee and rede ned thee, for thou ſhalt not
goe to hell, nor yet to Purgatorie: and I, although
miſerable, beſeech his diuine maieſtie, to beſtowe
it, and grant it thee, with plenarie remiſſion of
all thy ſinnes. This ſaide, the bleſſed Abbeſſe
went to communicate, and being rapte, the ſick
partie died, and ſhee ſawe that they caried her
ſoule to iudgment, taking of her a moſt ſtrict ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count

The holy virgin ſeeing this, cried out to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells,

pray you, for I truſt in the mercie of God he will

other nonnes ſaying that ſhe was deceiued; ſhe

               <p>8. Two ſick Religious, of which the one had two
cankers, and the other one vpon her breſt as bigg
as ones fiſt, were healed by commending them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
to their holy Abbeſſe. And one Religious
very ſick of an ague, asked for a little of the

bread which the mother Abbeſſe had left,
vneaten, and as ſoone as ſhe had put it into her
mouth, the ague left her, and ſhee remayned
whole and ſound. Another Religious had one
arme very dangerous ſoare with a great wound,
and asking of her good Angell that he would
obtaine of our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt true health
for that her ſicke ſiſter, he anſweared her: This
nonne hath a greater euill then you thinck, for
it is Saint Martiales fire, and ſuch as will not
heale vnleſſe it be by miracle. The fire beganne
to manifeſt it ſelf in her arme, and ſhee in ſuch
earneſt proſecuted her prayer, that ſhee obtained
of God health for the ſicke. To a little child ſick
of the euill of the hart, ſhe gaue health, making
vpon it the ſigne of the Croſſe. And to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor
of the conuent, being ſick of a phreneſie,
ſhe gaue health by bleſſing his meat. And like
vnto theſe ſhee did other miracles in the cure
of the ſicke, and in bringing to light many
things loſt, which were commended vnto her
prayers.</p>

be holden for a tradition very ancient, that ſome
Popes, and in eſpeciall Gregorie the 13. of happy

               <p>8. This is the hiſtorie of theſe miſteriou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
beades, of which the like ſo rarely hath beene
ſeene. And it is much to be noted, that our Lord
did this moſt notable fauour to his Church, in
a time when it was very neceſſarie: for it was at
the ſame time when Luther impudently and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegiouſly,
opened his excommunicated mouth
againſt the indulgences and Reades of pardon,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:15857:59"/>
which the Popes did grant, and againſt Agnus
Deies, and all kind of holy thinges. The virtues
of theſe beades are many, and by experience it is
knowne, that they haue virtue againſt the diuels,
for they driue them out of humane bodies, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
that they goe out of them, through the
virtue of theſe beades, and fly from thoſe that
carrie them about them. They haue virtue alſo
againſt fire, againſt thunder, lightening, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtes,
and troubles of the raging ſeaes, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
many infirmities, both of body and ſoule.
They heale agues, the peſtilence, and other
infirmities. They are alſo of force againſt ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
temptations, and frightes of the diuells.
Theſe and other virtues, our Sauiour granted
them, as is gathered by the miracles which
are approued; for of thoſe which are not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued
which are many, I do not ſpeake, becauſe
all that I ſhall ſpeake in this hiſtorie, I pretend
(to the honour and glory of God) that it be ſo

               <p>9. That which hath beene hitherto ſaide, hath
beene gathered from the informations afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned,
and eſpeciallie of that which vnder

and it is a publicke tradition fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe times, vnto
theſe, that theſe beades were in heauen, and our
Lord Ieſus Chriſt bleſſed them, granting them
many virtues and graces, without any perſon of
accoumpt hauing ſpoken againſt them; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
many Lordes of this kingdome, and great
prelates therof, haue procured of them, &amp; much
eſteemed them. King Philip the ſecond of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

King Philipp the third, and Margarite, haue two
of them, which they hould in very great eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:
And Pope Clement the eight of glorious me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie,
who before he was Pope came to Spaine,
with a brother of his, Auditor of the Rota, about
the buſineſſes of the earldome of Punnonroſtro,
went from Torreion of Velaſco to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uent of
the Croſſe where the body of B. Ioane is, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie
of Don Iohn Arrias Portocarrero, and the

of the life &amp; miracles of this virgin, &amp; of the
truth of theſe beades, after he had ſaide maſſe in
the Chappell where her body lieth, demanded of
ſiſter Ioane Euangeliſt then Abbeſſe, ſome of the
beades, and with much deuotion, carried with
him that which they gaue him. And the bleſſed
freers, freer Francis of Torres, and freer Iulian
of Saint Auguſtine, men of ſingular virtue,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:15857:60"/>
and ſanctitie, by whom in their life, &amp; after their
death God did many miracles, do affirme, that
theſe beades had bene carried vp to heauen, and
that Chriſt our redeemer had bleſſed them, and
granted them many virtues and pardons.</p>
               <p>10. And to the end that the faithfull might
enioye them, they perſwaded the people, that
they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhold touch their Roſaries and Beades, at
thoſe which they brought with them. And if
there were no other teſtimonie of the truth of
theſe beades, but only the ſanctitie of this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant
of God, and that only ſhe had affirmed it,
it were moſt ſufficient to perſwade vs, that ſhee
would not deceiue the Church, publiſhing falſe
virtues and graces. And leſſe can it be thought,
that ſhe was deluded by the diuell, who was ſo
much enlightened of God, and of her Angell
keeper. But that which fully proueth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth
the virtu &amp; truth of theſe beades, are the
many miracles which God hath wrought of his
goodnes, and in confirmation of them, and of
thoſe that haue touched them, which haue the

the many which the diuine maieſtie worketh,

The ſame is to bee iudged of the miracles which

by the virtue which God hath put in this bead
of the B. Ioane, I command thee, diuell, that

at that inſtant he went out of her, and ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:15857:61"/>
wholy melted in giuing thancks to our
Lord, and the aſiſtants with newe deuotion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubling
their feruor towards the beades.</p>
               <p>3. Dame Agnes of Luxan, religious of the

vpon her oath, that bringing to the ſaide
conuent a woman poſſeſſed, ſhee gaue her a bead
that ſhee had, and putting it about her necke, the
diuell went out of her that was poſſeſſed.</p>
               <p>4. Father freer Francis Caſtannoſa, of the
order of our holy Father S. Francis, diffinitor of
the holy prouince of Caſtile, declared alſo vnder

asked the poſſeſſed, wherfore ſhee ſtarted? who
anſwered, becauſe thou bringeſt with thee cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

diſſemble it, ſhewed his emptie handes &amp; ſaied:
doeſt thou not ſee that I bring nothing? but the

thou bringeſt beades of that ſame Ioane of the

anſwered: I will not tell thee. And in ſuch extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:15857:62"/>
was the poſſeſſed woman, as ſhe would
neuer conſent that they ſhould put vpon her
thoſe beades. Whereby was experienced, how
much the diuells do feare them.</p>
               <p>5. Iſabell of Cerro, neighbour of the towne
of Torreion de Velaſco, had three of theſe
Beades, and going out to heare the Maſſe of the

a poſſeſſed woman, who had her face all ſcrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched

the ſaid Beades, ſhee beganne forthwith to
ſweate, crying out and bleating like a goate,
whervpon the diuell went out of her: but as
ſoone as they were taken from her, ſhee was
poſſeſſed againe. Another time, putting vpon
her another Bead of one of the religious of our
holy Father S. Francis, the diuell went out of
her againe: &amp; that he might no more returne to
torment her, the Religious beſtowed that Bede
vpon her.</p>

She moued with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſion, put her Beades

               <p>8. Father freer Peeter of Salazar, conſultor
of the ſupreme councell of the holy inquiſition,

&amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed by much experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; by many mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles;
Eſpecially hee declared that the yeare paſt,
which was a thouſand ſix hundred and nine, the

of thunder and lightening, from which to be

defended, a woman of little Torreioncillo, called
Marie Buena, bleſt her ſelfe with a Bead of the B.
Ioane, and the tempeſt encreaſing, a thunderbolt
fell, which killed a little dogge ſhe had on her

this very miracle was approoued, &amp; the ſaid wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

the thinge is recounted as it happened.</p>
               <p>9. Moreouer, the aforſaid Father affirmed,
that going to Rome to the Generall chapter,
which was celebrated in the time of Sixtus
Quintus, being at ſea about the Port of Niza,
there aroſe ſo great a tempeſt, that all of them
were at the point to periſh: and being much
troubled and calling for helpe from heauen, hee
remembred himſelf, that he carried with him a
bead of B. Ioane, and caſting it into the ſea,
faſtned to a long corde, that he might get it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
in that inſtant the heauen cleered, and the
tempeſt ceaſſed, and the ſea was aſſwaged in
ſuch ſort, that they gained the hauen, and all of
them gaue many thanckes to God, for hauing
deliuered them from ſo manifeſt perill, by the
virtue of that bead, to the which all of them at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed

and ſo vnhoped for by the mariners.</p>
               <p>10. Chriſtofer of Cerro neighbour of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reion,
affirmed, that a great tempeſt of thunder,
hayle, and lightening fallinge, he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred

               <p>11. Luiſſa Roman, neighbour of Torreion,
fell into a great infirmitie, for which ſhe was
wholly deſpaired of by the phiſitions: and being
almoſt dead, they put about her neck the beades
of the B. Ioane, and ſhe ſawe in a dreame, that
a nonne of her habit put on her the ſaid beades,
and bad her take courage, for with thoſe ſhe

was found couered with a great ſweat, and
wholie healed, not without great admiration of
all thoſe who had ſeene her in ſo great perill, and
all prayſed our Lord for ſo great a meruaill.</p>
               <p>12. Anne of Lero, widowe, neighbour of
Torreion, was much oppreſſed with a palſey, in
ſuch ſort that ſhe could not ſtir her arme, nor

of the conuent of the Croſſe, declared, that
as ſhe eate a little fiſhe, a ſharp bone went
croſſe her throate; and fearing to choake
herſelf, ſhe commended it to the glorious
S. Blaſe: but ſeeing her ſelf ſtill oppreſſed of
her griefe, and calling to mind the beades of
B. Ioane, inuoked her help, and putting to
her throat one of the beades, at that very

wherwith the diuell did diſquiet her, procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
a beade of the B. Ioane, and only with
carying it about her, ſhe remained free from
the temptations of the diuell. And the ſame
bead put vpon a grandchild of the iuſtice
Villaroell in Madrid, who then was ſicke of
a ſtrong ague, ſhe remayned forthwith well:
diſcouering herein the virtue which our Lord
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:15857:65"/>
put in theſe beades, againſt the perills both
of ſoule and body.</p>
               <p>16. Marie Nunnes, a neighbour of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reion,
on a time ſaide to Iſabell of Cerro, her
neighbour, that there was no ſaluation for
her, for ſhe was condemned, and that her
Angell keeper had now forſaken her. The ſaid
Iſabell of Cerro hearing this, put in her ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
the beades of B. Ioane, with which ſhe ſlept
for the ſpace of an houre, and awaking ſhe
ſaide: Ah neighbour what is this you haue

both health, and remedie: and preſently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained

in to which ſhee formerly was fallen.</p>
               <p>17. Anne Lopez, a neighbour of the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſaid
place; prayed the ſaid Iſabell of Cerro,
to giue her one of thoſe beades, for to put it
vpon a ſonne of hers, which ſawe many euill
viſions, and after ſhe had put it on him, he
neuer ſawe them more, but remained very
quiet and well at eaſe. A little while after, Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell
prayed her to reſtore her the bead back
againe, being her ſonne was now well: but
ſhe couetous therof, would not rendre it,
wherupon the ſaid Iſabell of Cerro, ſaid: I
pray God thou maieſt neuer enioy it: and ſo
it happened, for Anne, ſaying her prayers
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:15857:65"/>

               <p>2. The bleſſed Father being in the yarde
where they of the towne of Villanueua dreſſe
their corne, there came to him Marie Sanz, wife
to Bartholomew de Onchell the elder, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſting
him that ſhe might touch her Roſarie,

               <p>3. In the towne of Meiorada, the ſeruant of
God being a touching other Roſaries, at the

Dias, daughter of Albertus de Cobeia, that he
might touch her ten beades, and the ſaint ſaide:
They haue beene touched at an other time, and
they haue the virtue of the beades of the B.

from the feares, and amazements which he ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted

               <p>5. A certaine Doctor was much troubled

he remained free, and with the ſame bead, caſt

               <p>6. Carrillo, prieſt and ſinging man of the

(becauſe for ſuch it was giuen him) comming

               <p>8. Dame Katharine of Salazar declared, that
a woman ſlaue of her mothers, had one of the
touched beades, and that going one day to the
market, ſhee ſawe many people about a poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

Which the people hearing, gaue place that the
ſlaue might come neer, and put the bead vpon
the poſſeſſed perſon, and at that inſtant the diuell
went out of him, leauing him free: all that were
preſent, admiring the virtue which God had put
in the ſaide beades.</p>
               <p>9. Iohn of Arriaga, a neighbour of Cubas,
had a broken bead of thoſe that were touched,
and going to the towne of Pinto, he found that
they were exorciſing in the Church, a woman
poſſeſſed by the diuell: who ſo ſoone as he ſawe
him, beganne to cry out, that they ſhold put
from thence that man, for he bringes a bead of
Iugg of the Croſſe, which tormented him more
then hell it ſelfe: and the ſaid Arriaga, gaue it
to the prieſt which exorciſed, and putting it
vpon the poſſeſſed, the diuell went forthwith
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:15857:69"/>
out of her, and left her free.</p>
               <p>10. Catharine of S. Anne, an old religious
of the conuent of the Croſſe, gaue to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
man, one of theſe beades, and he thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
that it was of the originalls, expected
the houre to make experience of it, and of
the virtue it had againſt the diuells: and
meeting with one poſſeſſed, and putting it
vpon him, the diuell fell into great extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
ſaying moſt furiouſly: it is not a beade
of S. Ioane that caſteth me out, but a bead
of S. Anne; for ſo was the religious called
that gaue it him, becauſe it was not an ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall,
but of thoſe that were touched therat.</p>
               <p>11. Many other miracles I leaue to ſett
downe; for it ſeemeth to me that theſe do
ſufficiently proue the virtue of theſe beades,
and that which they haue that are touched
at them, and ſuch are the moſt of thoſe that
are extant: for of thoſe originall Beades
which our Lord bleſſed in heauen, there are
verie fewe, being that with the time they
haue beene loſt and conſumed. In the conue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
of the Croſſe there are two, ſince the time of
the glorious Ioane: and among the nonnes
therof ſome are found, and other particular
perſons alſo haue of them. In the towne of
Cubas, ſo nere to the conuent of the Croſſe,

are found ſome of them, ſo much eſteemed
of thoſe who haue them, that they are here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditarie

them by will of teſtament when they dye, for
the great deuotion they haue to the ſaide

three beades touched at that of Ioane of the

Croſse, the which thou weareſt on thy wriſtes
and throate: Wherin was manifeſt, that it was
the diuell who ſpake in that man, becauſe this
was ſo ſecret, that none at all knewe thereof.
And it was more knowen, becauſe at the firſt
exorciſmes, the curate commanded him to tell
who he was, and he ſaid ſatan. Then the curate
demanding ſome bead of B. Ioane, they gaue
him a Roſarie which he put about his neck, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the poſseſsed refuſed it much, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne
to make manie faces and geſtures, making

griefes: wherupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the curate asking of him, what
he felt? he anſwered, that he felt greater paines
and torment with that Roſarie, then if for three
thouſand yeares he had beene in hell, ſuffering
all the paines and torments, which there are
ſuffered: and this he ſaide with a voice ſo terrible
and ſo ſorrowfull, as hee feared all that heard it.
Being asked by the curate whoſe thoſe beades
were which ſo much did torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t him? he anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that they were Ioanes of the Croſſe: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
asking him if they were of the originalls:
he anſwered no, but of thoſe that were touched,
at them; addinge that he would goe out of that
body, if they would take them away, for they
much burned him. The curate tooke them
away, and in the ſight of all, the diuell went
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:15857:73"/>
out of the body, and neuer returned againe, but
rather from that time forward they haue ſeene
him do many things of deuotion, &amp; aske beades
of the Saint, which he carrieth about him. The
originall information of this caſe as it hath beene
recounted, is in the conuent of the Croſſe.</p>
               <p>11. In the towne of Madrid it happened in

to her ſelfe, and was well, with great admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to all thoſe that ſawe her, who remained

by meanes of the beades of this his ſeruant are

they whold containe a great volume. Wherfore
leauing many, I will recount one publicke, and
notorius meruaill, ſeene and examined by many
people, which at this day, and euery day God
worketh in the towne of Grinnon, ſix leagues
from the courte of our Lord the King, vpon a
woman taken with ſo greate ſoundinges, as
comming vpon her very often, they are wont to
dure her two dayes and nights together: pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
of a ſtrong euill of a ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning goute, which
becauſe ſhe hath had it many yeares, and is an
aged perſon, it is incurable in her, as the phiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
affirme which haue had her in cure. Being
as it were dead with this euill, and with theſe ſo
great ſoundinges, depriued of all kind of ſenſe,
if they put on her a bead of the B. Ioane, ſhe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to her ſelfe, ſaying Ieſus: and if they take
it of, preſently ſhe falleth into her ſound a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
the ſame effect being knowen to be as
oft as they take it of and put it on; in ſuch ſort
as the ſound taking her, her remedie conſiſteth
in that they put on her the bead. And this is a
thing ſo knowen there about, that whoſoeuer
hath any of theſe beades, to be out of doubt, &amp;
to know if they be true, they goe and make ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience

Iohn Ninno, Vice-commiſſarie generall of the

Salamanca, hearing of ſo pittyfull a caſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring
to put ſome remedie therto, together with
the two religious, who had charge to repayre
to the ſpirituall comforth of the religious, went
the firſt day of Eaſter to the pallace of the Lord
Biſhopp, where the religious liued with their
Abbeſſe: and thoſe which were ſound, receiued
them in a high hall after the manner of a chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
where they ſawe an altar wheron ſtood the
B. Sacrament with lights, and ſome of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon
their knees.</p>
                  <p>16. After they had made their prayer, they
brought forth thoſe that were poſſeſſed: who ſo
much refuſed it, that they came with an euill will
&amp; by force, crying out, and foming at the mouth,
ſcratching their faces, and ſweating through
great affliction and vexation. For remedy therof,
the ſaid Father Iohn, hauing a bead of the B.
Ioane of the Croſſe, put it vpon the head of one
of thoſe which was poſſeſſed, without telling
her whoſe it was; but forthwith ſhe beganne to
manifeſt it, crying with aloude voice &amp; making

hurting her owne ſelfe, ſaide: take it away, take
it away: the Father wold not do it, but asked her
what ſhee felt with that bead which ſo pained

her. To which ſhe anſwered in french, that they
ſhould take away the bead, for although they

this he commanded her in virtue of the holy
Ghoſt, and the prieſtly dignitie which he had,
that he ſhould tell him what ſhe felt with that
beade, and whoſe it was? The poſſeſſed partie
ſtood a good while without anſwering any
thing, vntill forcing her by exorciſme ſhe ſaid,
that that beade was of Ioane the Spaniard, and
that with it ſhe felt ſo much fire, after they had
put it vpon her head, as if they had put her into
a burning ouen. He alſo asked her what virtue
that bead had: and although at the beginning

and of his ſeruant the B. Ioane of the Croſſe, ſhe
ſhould tell which was the greateſt it had, ſhe
ſaide: It hath virtue againſt vs. And asking her
from whence the beade had that virtue; ſhe
anſwered, that from the benediction of God
aboue. And that an Angell had carried it vp,
(pointing towards heauen) to the end it ſhold be
bleſſed of God.</p>
                  <p>17. Whileſt this paſſed thus with this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious

God had bleſt it, from whence it had the virtue
which it had. And becauſe at the beginning, the
Fathers did not well vnderſtand ſome worde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which the poſſeſſed parties ſpake, for that it was
in French, they were explicated vnto them by
the two religious men, who had them in
charge, and by a Doctor of Phyſicke which
had them in cure. It was alſo ſeene, that tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
their Roſaries at the ſaide bead, the
diuell did the ſame, confeſſing that they had the
ſame virtue, and putting in the mouth of one of
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a Roſarie touched at the ſaid bead, ſhe made
ſtrange faces, and cryed out, ſaying: that if they
tooke it not from her, ſhe would teare them in
pieces: and the ſaid Father made her anſweare,
that ſhe could not do it, for that the beades of
that Roſarie had virtue from God: and ſhe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweared:
it is true, I cannot, and ſo ſhe did them
no maner of dammage.</p>
                  <p>18. It was alſo ſeene, that with another of
the ſaid beades which Father Cauanillas one of
the forenamed carried, the ſame ſucceeded: and
that Father Peter Iouer, carried with him two
beades, which had bene giuen him in Caſtile,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:15857:78"/>
although of the one hee were doubtfull, if it
were a right one yea or no, becauſe the perſon
which had giuen him them, told him, that for
the one it was moſt certaine, but for the other
he held it not for ſo certaine. And the ſaide Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
asking of one of the poſſeſſed, that for the
honour and glory of God and of his Saint, ſhe
would tell him if thoſe beades were of Saint
Ioane, ſhe anſwered that the one was moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
pointing to that which for ſuch had beene
giuen him, and that the other was not of the
true beades. It was alſo ſeene, how in preſence
of thoſe which were there (as to all it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red)
the diuell went out of the bodies of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
which were poſſeſſed, in putting on the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the aforeſaid bead, for the ſame inſtant that the
diuell left them, they remained wearie and
ſweating exceedingly, they made the ſigne of
the Croſſe, and bleſſed themſelues, and thoſe

in prayer, and her ſpirit in that celeſtiall
place where God was wont to put it, ſhee ſawe,
(as another Prophet Eſaias) the Lord of Hoſte
ſeated in a throne, of moſt great maieſtie and
glory, compaſſed with infinite Angells, and
Saints, who gaue rewards, and commanded that

ſhrill and ſtrong a voice, as it were the noyſe of
a great water. Wilt thou not my daughter haue

               <p>5. Another time being in a moſt profound
rapte, there came to viſite her the glorious Saint
Barbara, to whom ſhe was particularly deuoted:
and reaſoning with her, ſaide: You well knowe,
Lady, how much this your vnworthie ſeruant
deſireth to ſerue you. Yea I know, it well ſiſter
(anſwered S. Barbara) and I would alſo that
you ſhould knowe I loue you in our Lord, and
hold you for my ſingular, and deuoted frend.
With this the B. virgines ended their talke,
which ſcarcely was ended, when the ſoule of a
childe which had newely expired, did appeare
vnto her, praying her to ſpeake to her mother
to chaſtiſe her children, for ſhe ſhould giue a
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:15857:82"/>
ſtrict account to God our Lord for their euill
breeding: and I giue his maieſtie many thancks,
for hauing brought me to his holy kingdom
in ſo tender age, for if I had come to be great, I
had beene damned by the ill education of my
mother. Bid her looke to my brothers, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtize
them before they be greater, and come to
be loſt. My mother is called ſuch an one, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
in ſuch a place, and is the wife of ſuch an
one. With this the ſeruant of God ſent to call
her, and recounted all that had paſſed, with ſuch
aſſured ſignes, as ſhe could not doubt there of:
and ſhe from that time forward was ſo much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
to the ſeruant of God, that ſhe viſited her
very oft, making profit of the holy counſells
which ſhe gaue her.</p>
               <p>6. Euerie yeare vpon the fundation of the
conuent of the Croſſe, is celebrated therin the
apparition of the Queene of Angells, the firſt
nine dayes of March; on the which the B. virgin
appeared (as hath beene ſaide) and euery yeare
on theſe 9. dayes at the houre of matines, the
ſeruant of God ſawe a moſt ſolemne proceſſion,
in which the mother of God came with many
Angells and Saints, and the ſoules of many reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
of that howſe, and of other perſons de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
which were in bliſſe, and had beene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoute
to that holy apparition: and alſo thoſe
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:15857:82"/>
which were in Purgatorie, for the virgin tooke
them out on this holy Feaſt. And before they
entred into the conuent, they went in proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
round about it, giuing her bleſſing to the
fieldes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lying round about the monaſterie, in the
which ſhe entred by and by, and went ſtreight
to the dormitorie of the religious where they
were retired, ſome at prayers, and others ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping.
To all of them ſhe gaue her bleſſing with
words of moſt great charitie, and loue, &amp; ſpake
with their Angells keepers: who preſented to
her the prayers, and good deſires, wherwith
they had prepared themſelues to celebrate the
feaſt of her holy apparition. And our B. Lady
ſaid; Be conſtant in your laboures, for ſo are the
crownes of heauen gained.</p>
               <p>7. Other times ſhe commanded their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells
kepers, they ſhould put them Garlandes of
Roſes on their heades, although they did not ſee
them, nor knowe of them. And ſometimes ſhe
reprehended them with moſt ſweet wordes.
From hence ſhe went to the quire with all that
celeſtiall companie, and aſſiſted at the martines,
the bleſſed Ioane in ſpirite being preſent at all,
went with the proceſſion. On the morrowe at
highe Maſſe, comming to her ſelfe, ſhe went
to the quire, wher ſhe heard the diuine office &amp;
ſermon, and ſawe the proceſſion. And at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:15857:83"/>
ſhe was wont to be eleuated, and when
ſhe came to her ſelfe, the religious entreated
her, to tell what ſhe had ſeene: and ſhe with
much humilitie, recounting that which hath
beene ſaid, could them, that ſhe had ſeene the
Queene of heauen in that proceſſion, and that
ſhe bleſſed thoſe which had come to celebrate
the feaſt of her holy apparition: that they ſhould
be very deuote to the ſame, and to the moſt
holy virgin, for at her inſtance God beſtowed
on this Church many graces and fauoures.</p>
               <p>8. There was in this monaſterie an image of
miracles very ancient, to which the nonnes had
much deuotion, and carried it in proceſſion the
day of the apparition: but becauſe it was nowe
very old and without luſtre, they made the head
and face anewe: and that the ſeruant of God
might ſee it (who lay ſicke, in bed) they carried
it to her cell, where for her comfort they left it
her vpon an altar: and that ſame night the Saint
being at prayer, ſaw in an imaginarie viſion, the
Queene of Angells, who ſtood by the image:
whom the ſeruant of God prayed to grant ſome
fauour to her image: and the night following at
the houre of matines, ſhe ſawe how Chriſt our
Lord appeared vnto her, and bleſſed the image,
which from that time is much reuerenced for
the tradition of this miracle. And of theſe is God

wont to do many according to the neceſſitie of
the times: But at this time the heretiques doing
ſo many iniuries to holy images, they will cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
amiſſe of this maruaill; which our Lord did
for their confuſion, and for the confirmation
of the ancient cuſtome of the Church.</p>
               <p>9. In this ſeruant of our Lord, that was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced,
which the Saints ſay, that it is a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
meanes, for to attaine to the toppe of
Chriſtian perfection, to haue deuotion to our B.
Lady the virgin, to whom this her humble ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant
was ſo deuote, that from a very child ſhe
vſed to recite her Roſarie, and not hauing one of
beades, ſhe made one of a cord, with knottes in
place of the Pater noſters, and Aue marias. And
being waxen bigger, as ſhe encreaſed in age, ſo
ſhe encreaſed in this holy deuotion; in ſuch ſort,
as when the feaſtes of our B. Lady came, to her
great penances, faſtes and ordinarie exerciſes, ſhe
added others extraordinarie, with which ſhe
diſpoſed herſelfe to celebrate them worthilie.
For which the fauours were very great which
God did her on theſe dayes, and greater &amp; more
frequent were her raptes, in the which our Lord
tooke her tongue, for inſtrument to publiſh the
prayſes of his moſt holy mother: And ſo this
ſeruant of our Lord being in prayer, and abſtract
from her ſenſes in the great eleuations &amp; raptes
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:15857:84"/>
which we ſhall ſue in the enſuing chapter, one
day of the Annuntiation of our B. Lady, in the
yeare 1508. contemplating that ſo maruellous
worcke of the Incarnation of the word, which
that day the Church repreſenteth, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
humilitie wherwith the moſt ſacred vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
gaue her conſent to be mother of God, ſhe
ſaid. That when the diuine word tooke fleſh in
her virginall wombe, ſhe ſawe in that inſtant
the diuine eſſence, and many other miſteries,
which were reuealed to her (as graue authores
haue affirmed) and that ſhe did merit more
in that houre, obeying to the will of God, and
giuing credit to the wordes of the Angell, then
all the Angells had merited when they yelded
their obedience to God, more then all the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyres
in their martyrdomes, more then all the
confeſſoures in as many penances as they did,
and more then all the virgines in the virginitie,
and puritie which they kept. (<hi>Our B. Lady ſawe
the diuine eſſence in the incarnation of the word S.
Antonin. 4. parte titulo. 15. c.</hi> 17. §. 1.)</p>
               <p>10. So alſo vpon a certaine day of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation
of our B. Lady, in the yeare 1509. this
B. Saint being in a rapte, which endured her for
many houres, ſhe ſaide, that from that inſtant in
which the moſt excellent Queene of Angells
was conceiued in the wombe of her mother S.
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:15857:84"/>
Anne, ſhe had the vſe of reaſon, as if ſhe had
beene of perfect age, together with great loue
and knowledge of almightie God, wherin ſhe
alwayes encreaſed, and in all other virtues vntill
ſhee came to be (among the pure creatures) the
moſt perfect and holy of as many as haue beene,
or euer ſhall be in heauen or in earth. (<hi>Our B.
Lady had vſe of reaſon in the wombe of her mother
from the firſt instant of her conception, S. Bernardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus

               <p>11. Another time, on the day of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of our Lord, in the yeare 1508. being ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uated,
ſhe ſaide, that when our Lord Ieſus
Chriſt went out of the ſepulchre glorious, and
riſen againe, he appeared firſt (before to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
perſon) to his moſt ſacred mother, for that
ſhe had moſt of all others felt his death, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
paſſion, and in whom was moſt liuely the
hope of the holy Reſurrection. (<hi>S. Bonauent. in

6. S. Anion. de Padua ſerm. in die ſancto Paſchatis,
and S. Brigit lib. 6. of her reuelations.</hi>) Theſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoures,
and many others did God to his ſeruant
on the feaſtes of his moſt ſacred mother, but eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
on that of the moſt pure conception, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
to this feaſt ſhe was moſt deuote: which
ſhe celebrated with particular ioy and deuotion:
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:15857:85"/>
and that her religious alſo might haue the ſame,
ſhe made them on theſe dayes moſt deuout
ſpeaches.</p>
               <p>12. One day of the moſt pure Conception in
the yeare 1509. being in prayer, ſhe was eleua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in a moſt profound rapte, which endured
her for ſome houres: and ſo remayning for an
houre together, ſhe neuer left ſpeaking, recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
worthie things and prayſes of our B. Lady:
as, calling her, the moſt pure, the roſe among
thornes, ſhe which only among the children of
Adam, was conceiued without originall ſinne.
And explicated the Ghoſpell. <hi>Beatus venter qui te
portauit,</hi> which is that, that on that day the
Church doth recite in the proper office: and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other authorities of the ſacred ſcripture and
the Pſalmes, all vttered in prayſe of the Queene
of Angells. Theſe and many other things of
much edification the bleſſed Abbeſſe vttered to
her religious in the ſpirituall ſpeaches ſhe made
them, beſide the ſermons which being eleuated
ſhe preached vnto them, which cauſed ſo great
admiration in thoſe that heard them, wherof
mention is made in the chapter following.</p>
               <p>13. There was brought to the ſeruant of
God, a ſucking child very ſicke, that ſhe mighe
giue it her benediction, and as ſoone as ſhe ſawe
it, our Lord reuealing to her that it was poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:15857:85"/>
ſhe ſaide to the religious with great affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of her ſpirite. Great is the height of the
ſecretes of God, when his diuine maieſtie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth,
that the diuell hath power to torment
this innocent childe, which is but ſeauen mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths
old: I pray you ſiſters, let vs commend it
to God. And making vpon it the ſigne of the
Croſſe, it remained free from that euill ſpirite,
which did before ſo much torment it. We may
ſay of this childe, that which Chriſt ſaide of the
blind man, that he was not blind for his owne
ſinnes, nor for the ſinnes of his Fathers, but for
the glory of God, which in the healing of it,
was to be manifeſted. It happened many times
to this ſeruant of our Lord, that being in prayer
in her cell, praying to God for ſuch perſons as
were commended to her prayers, ſhe ſawe them
all, and their neceſſities and trauaills, and that
ſo clearly, and ſo diſtinctly, as if ſhe had had the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
there preſent: which recounting once to her An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
keeper, he anſwered: that God had ſhewed
them vnto her, to the end ſhe ſhould the more
charitablie, and the more feruently, be mindfull
of them in her prayer.</p>
               <p>14. The Angells viſiting the B. Ioane vpon
a certaine day, they ſaid vnto her, that with ſo
great affect of loue one might feele and deplore
the paſſion of Chriſt Ieſus our Lord, that it
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:15857:86"/>
might be ſo acceptable a ſacrifice to his diuine
maieſtie, as if he ſhould haue ſhed his bloud, &amp;
ſhould haue ſuffered great trauaills for his ſake,
ſo much doth the memorie of his ſacred paſſion
pleaſe him. Theſe things &amp; many others (quoth
ſhee to her religious) doth my holy Angell
ſhewe vnto me, by the will of God; and both
for myne profit, and for yours, I relate them to
you, and aſſure you that our Lord hath done me
ſo much fauour, and that he hath giuen me ſo
much light and charitie in them, that moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
I knowe them to be his, and for ſo true
and certaine I hold them, as I would ſweare
they are his, if I were put vnto to it vpon my
oath, although becauſe my ſoule had not ſo
much charitie at the beginning, I did not receiue
ſo much comfort in the reuelations which our
Lord did ſhewe me, as now I doe. For the which
I miſerable ſinner, giue infinite thancks to his
diuine maieſtie.</p>

ſpake for the ſpace of thirteene yeares maruelous
things (being eleuated) and of the gift of
tongues which our Lord granted
her.</head>
               <p>1 ONe of the greateſt laboures which the
B. Ioane had in this life, was, that many
perſons deſiring to know the fauoures which
God had done her, and the ſecrets which in
thoſe extaſies and raptes he reuealed to her, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
it of her many times. And wheras the B.
virgin was ſo humble, ſhe tooke this in ſuch
manner, as ſhe affirmed, that ſhe had much rather
relate her faultes, then the mercies and fauoures
which God had done her. And if ſhe told of
ſome of thoſe which are written in this hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
it was for that God had ſo commanded her,
ſome times by himſelfe, other times by the
Angell of her garde. And wheras by this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
ſhe was much diſcomforted, our Lord wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to deliuer her fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the tediouſneſſe (and alſo
to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort his ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, who deſired to know theſe
things, for whoſe good his maieſtie had wrought
many of them) he vſed this meanes, as to ſtrike
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:15857:87"/>
her dumbe, and to make him ſelfe ſpeake by the
mouth of his eſpouſe: and ſo our Lord appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to her and comforting her, ſhe remained
ſpeechles for ſome moneths: and after againe
appearing to her in another rapte, touching her
with his diuine hand, ſhe remained ſound; but
in the time of her dumbeneſſe, and for ſome
yeares after, the ſeruant of God being eleuated,
did preach, vttering by the diuine virtue mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelous
ſentences, explicating propheties and
difficult places of ſacred ſcripture, to the great
admiration of all thoſe that heard her, ſeing ſo
manifeſtly the virtue of our Lord in his ſeruant.
This moſt ſingular grace laſted her thirteene
yeares, ſpeaking ſome times euery eight dayes,
or fifteene dayes, other times euery foure dayes,
other times euery third day, other times one day
after another, and ſome dayes twice, more or
leſſe, as it pleaſed our Lord.</p>
               <p>2. This great maruaill being diuulged
through the kingdome, much people came to
ſee her, although not all with equall intention;
for ſome had a very euill opinion of her: but for
greater confuſion of theſe, and of others incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous,
being rapte ſhe ſpake vnto them, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that God reuealed her what they had in
their hartes, and reprehending them, ſhe ſaide:
who art thou who wilt limite the power of
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:15857:87"/>
God? hath not the now the ſame he had alwayes?
can he not infuſe his grace into who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he pleaſe?
can he not make a veſſell which may containe
it? To this purpoſe it fell out, that a certaine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitor,
very zealous about things of faith, not
being able to ſuffer, that it ſhould bee ſaide, that
the holy Ghoſt did ſpeake by the mouth of this
B. woman, came to heare her, with intent to
examine her wordes; but thoſe ſhe ſpake that
very day were ſuch, as in the middeſt of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
the inquiſitor fell vppon his knees, and
ſatte ſo ſhedding teares, vntill the ſeruant of
God had ended her preaching: and comming
to her ſenſes, he prayed her to let him ſee her
at the grate: and giuing himſelfe great ſtrokes
vpon the breſt, he ſaide: I came to examin the
wordes of God, but now I know, that they are
his, whatſoeuer I haue heard from this holy
woman. And after hauing ſpoken with her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
commending himſelfe to her prayers, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he
returned, no little edified at the humilitie which
he acknowledged in her, remayning much affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to her doctrine.</p>
               <p>3. For greater teſtimonie that this buſineſſe
was from heauen, often times they heard her
ſpeake in diuers languagues, of which ſhe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
had any former knowledge, eſpecially in
Latin, Arabick, and others. The Lord Biſhopp
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:15857:88"/>
of Auila, freer Francis Ruiz, was moſt deuote
to this holy virgin, and out of his charitie, gaue
to the conuent two ſlaues, Mores which he had
brought from the conqueſt of Oran, where he
had beene to accompany the Lord Cardinall,
freer Francis Ximenes. Theſe two Mores, were
ſo obſtinate in the lawe of Mahomet, that in
only propoſing them the lawe of Chriſt, and
asking them if they would be Chriſtians, they
would weepe bitterly, and teare their faces euen
till the bloud came out of them. They carried
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on a time to B. Ioane, becauſe ſhe preached
in the former manner: and turning her ſpeach
to the Mores, ſhe ſpake vnto them in Algaua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,
and they alſo anſwered in the ſame la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>guage:
and ſuch things ſhe recounted to them, as ſhe
conuerted them to the faith, and they were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.
And after being rapte, ſhe ſpake to them
other times in Arabicke, and many times in
Latin, as alſo with ſome learned men which
came to heare her, putting them in mind of
particular caſes, and of defects of theirs.</p>
               <p>4. Notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nding all theſe experiences
and many others which were ſeene, becauſe it
was ſo vnaccuſtomed and maruellous a thing,
the Prelates of the order, to ſtop the cenſures of
ſome euill tongues, commanded the Abbeſſe
that when ſhe ſpake in that manner, they ſhould
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:15857:88"/>
ſhut her vp into her cell, that none ſhould heare
her, although they were of the religious them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.
But on a time our Lord permitting it,
being left alone, and ſhut vp, ſhe ſtayed ſo long
before ſhe returned from her rapte, that the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſſe
carefull of the ſucceſſe, ſent a nonne to
knowe what was done; and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to the cell
where the virgin was, ſhe ſawe many birdes of
diuers coloures, ſtretching out their neckes, as if
they did harken what ſhe ſaide (whom God
had ſent to hearke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to her) which ſhe recounting
to the Abbeſſe, ſhe went with ſome religious
to her celle, and they found all true which the
nonne had tole; Wherin it was knowen to be
the will of our Lord that they ſhould heare his
ſeruant, and what he ſpake by her mouth. So
longe as there were ſome doubtes hereof, and
of the truth of theſe thinges, it was good to hide
them from the world, ſo to temper the varietie
of iudgments ther vpon. But when the things
themſelues giue a certaintie, that God is their
author, which the miracle of the birdes made
moſt manifeſt, it ſhould haue bene iniuſt in men
to haue ſuppreſt it. And ſo the Prouinciall
being informed of this maruell, granted, that
ſpeaking in thoſe raptes, ſome principall perſons
might heare her, and whom he gaue licence
to (for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uent at that time was nor encloſed)
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:15857:89"/>
With this newe licence, drawen by the fame of
theſe great maruells, there came infinite people
eccleſiaſtical, and ſecular, Preachers, Lawiers, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
of all orders, Canons, Inquiſitors, Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hopps,
the great Captain Conſalo Fernandes de
Cordoua, the Cardinall of Toledo, freer Francis
Ximenes, many Earles, Dukes, Marqueſſes,
Lordes and Ladies of all eſtates, witneſſes of
this miſterie, who haue ſeene it oftentimes for
the ſpace of 13. yeares. And among them one
that would ſee this maruell with his owne eyes
was our Lord the Emperor Charles the V. who
remayned much affectioned to the ſeruant of
God.</p>
               <p>5. Our Lord gaue this grace to this ſeruant
at foure and twentie yeares of age, which ſhe
neuer enioyed but being in rapte: &amp; many times
it appered, they heard her ſpeake with the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells,
with the Apoſtles, and Saints, as who had
our Lord preſent, before whom ſhe made her
petitions, praying for all the perſons of the
world in generall, for ſome in particular, and for
the ſoules in Purgatorie. This done ſhe ioyned
her handes (all ſeing her) and making many very
profound, &amp; humble inclinations with her head
ſhe prayed ſo in ſecret, as no word was heard,
but only ſawe her moue her lippes as a perſon
that prayed, or ſpake. And after with her hands
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:15857:89"/>
ioyned, ſhe remained in moſt great ſilence. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
came the religious, and lifting her from the
ground, ſhee not feeling it, they carryed her to
her cell, and layde her on her bedd, and forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
with loude voice and ordered, in very pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
and ſweet tone (that all that ſtood there
vnderſtood it) ſhe ſpake maruaillous thinges.
Finally the ſaid ſermons, and ſpirituall ſpeaches,
were of much edification and profit, declaring
the ſacred ſcripture and Goſpells of the yeare,
conforme to the feaſtes therof, euery ſermon,
during, the ſpace of foure, fiue, ſix, and ſeauen
houres, without reſting, nor mouing more then
the tongue, for in the reſt ſhe was as one dead;
in ſo much that a certain Lady, on a time hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the ſermon &amp; being very neere her, ſtucke
a pinne into her head, in ſuch manner as ſhe
drewe bloud: and although at that time ſhe felt
it not, yet being returned from her rapt, ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
much therof.</p>
               <p>6. Another time as ſhe was preaching, there
came to her an eccleſiaſticall perſon and very no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and taking her by the arme, which ſhe held
faſt to her breſt, threwe it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him very ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gly,
to ſee if ſhe made any motion, or complained
of the grief: but ſhee inſenſible to all this, went
forward with that ſhe was ſaying, and the arme
remayned ſo fallen, vntill a religious came, and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:15857:90"/>
put it vpon her breſt as before ſhe held it. She
ſpake with ſuch grace, mildnes, and ſweetneſſe
as the ſermons being ſo long as they were, yet
none was euer weary of them. When the holy
virgin had ended and was returned to herſelf, ſhe
rentained moſt beautifull, her face, her veſture,
and perſon all ſhining, and all things which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
to her, ſauoring of a celeſtiall ſmell. And
out of the great vehemencie wherwith ſhe had
ſpoken, ſhe remained with ſuch abundance of
ſweat, as ordinarily they changed her habit, and
dreſſings: and when ſhe returned to her ſenſes,
they cauſed her to eate, becauſe ſhe was very
fainte &amp; feeble: &amp; it was an admirable thing that
ſhe felte nothing of what foeuer paſſed about
her exteriorly, if afterward it were not told her.
And becauſe the times which are to come, might
haue knowledge of ſo great maruailles, our
Lord gaue wiſdome and grace to a religious
which could not read nor write, called Siſter
Marie Euangeliſt, to write a great booke, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled,
of the Mariners carde, which conteineth
the ſermons the glorious Ioane preached in one
yeare: two other religious helping her, called ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
Catharine of S. Francis, and ſiſter Catharine
of the martyres: wherof there is tradition, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blique
voice and fame in the monaſterie of the
Croſſe, and ſome ancient religious, which liue
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:15857:90"/>
at this day, knewe the ſaid ſiſter Marie Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt,
and ſweare that they know her hand, and
heard her ſpeake it many times.</p>
               <p>7. This booke of the Carde, conteineth ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentie
and two ſermons, diuided into as many
chapters, written in ſeuenhundred &amp; thre leaues
in folio; and is kept in the conuent as a relique
of great eſteeme, and with great reaſon, all what
ſoeuer is in it, being miraculous: as is alſo it,
that a woman ſhould haue written it, without
knowing how to read, or write: &amp; ſhould beare
in memorie all whatſoeuer the bleſſed prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
had ſaide; in ſuch ſort that making an end
to heare the ſermon, ſhe wrote the ſame, ſome
of them contayning twelue, and ſome twentie
ſheetes of paper, full of Theologie, and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of ſacred ſcripture. And only in one yeare,
taking part of that of 1508. and part of 1509. this
bleſſed woman wrote, three hundred ſixtie and
fiue ſheetes, the nomber that this booke contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
of a very legible and plaine letter, although
nowe the time, and the wormes haue much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damaged

and delight in hearing the little birdes to

employ her loue on any other thing, but on
himſelfe, and in token of the loue his maieſtie
bore her, he wrought in her a ſoueraigne mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaill,
ſeene and experiented of very many, and
eſpecially of all the religious of the conuent,
which freer Alonſo de Mena, her confeſſor,
freer Alonſo de Tarracena his companion, and
other religious &amp; graue Fathers of the order, all
ſawe it, and made experience of it: the caſe
was this. Our Lord willing to enrich &amp; honour

his beloued eſpouſe, gaue her for pretious
Iewells, the paines and ſignes of his moſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
woundes, the hiſtorie and miraculous
ſucceſſe wherof, paſſed in this manner.</p>
               <p>2. In the yeare of our Lord one thouſand
fiue hundred twentie and foure, the virgin
being fourtie and three yeares of age, one
yeare after the conceſſion of the beades, it
happened, that on Good friday in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
being in prayer, ſet in Croſſe wiſe, ſhe
was rapte, her armes ſo ſtretched out and
ſtiffe, as alſo all the members of her body, as
if it had beene a Crucifix of ſtone, in ſuch
ſort that no humane force could ſtir her fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
that holy compoſture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> although it was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted. The no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes ſeing her rapte, &amp;
in ſo differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t a poſture to that which at other
times ſhee was wont to be, and that the rapte
continued longe, they carried her vnto her
cell, and went all to the quire, becauſe it
was time to beginne the diuine office. Being
in the office, while the paſſion was read, the
virgin entred into the quire, ſhedding many
teares. The nonnes ſeeing her come and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to the walles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who for that ſhe could not
goe nor keepe herſelfe vpon her feete, ſhe
went barefooted (as ſhee was accuſtomed:)
and becauſe ſhe could not ſet them to the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:15857:93"/>
ground, ſhe went only vpon her heeles and
toes, with ſo much difficultie as if ſhe had
ſet her eyes where ſhe ſet her feet. The non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
ſeing this, asked her the reaſon of it by
ſignes they made her (for being deafe, ſhe
vnderſtood not otherwiſe) how ſhe came in
that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner? who made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> anſwere, that ſhe
could not goe, becauſe her feet grieued her
ſo much. Let vs ſee them (ſaide the nonne
that wrote this hiſtorie) and then they ſawe
that ſhe had in her feet &amp; handes, the ſignes
of our B. Sauiour crucified, being rounde, of the
bigneſſe of a ſixpence, of the colour of
roſes very fleſh, and redd, and of which fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
and colour they were equallie, both on
the toppes and ſoles of her feet, and on her
handes aboue and belowe: and out of them
iuſſed ſuch fragrancie of ſauour, as nothing
created could be comparable vnto it: ſhe
complaining of the great paine and griefe
that theſe ſignes did cauſe her.</p>
               <p>3. The religious ſeeing her in this plight,
wept for deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and gaue thancks to God,
for what they had ſeene with their eyes and
felt with their owne hands. And taking her
in their armes (for ſhe could not goe nor ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteine
herſelfe vpon her feet) they carried
her into her cell: and making her a thouſand
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:15857:93"/>
chreriſhings, with tenderneſſe and deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
they asked her by ſignes: (becauſe it was in
the time that ſhe was deafe) what markes
thoſe were? who had giuen her them? or howe
they had beene there made? To the which
ſhe anſwered, that being in that moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
place, where by commandme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God
the Angell of her garde had carried her, ſhe
ſawe our Lord Ieſus Chriſt crucified, who
touching her with his moſt ſacred woundes,
left her with moſt grieuous doloures in her
handes and feet. And this ſoueraigne viſion
ended, ſhe found herſelfe in her cell, and in
her ſenſes, with thoſe markes, which endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
her from this good Friday, vntill the day
of the Aſcenſion, although ſhe had the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not
euery day, but only fridaies and ſaturdaies:
Vpon the ſonday, at the houre that our Lord
aroſe, both the paines and the markes quite
departed, without any more apparence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
of them, then if ſhe neuer had the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
And being ſo humble as ſhe was, with much
humilitie, and teares of deuotion, ſhe praied
her moſt holy eſpouſe, he would not permit
that ſo pretious and rich Iewells, ſhould be
emploied vpon a creature ſo vile as ſhee; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching
his diuine maieſtie, he would take
them away, for it ſeemed to her a thing of
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:15857:94"/>
little ſecuritie, to expoſe to the ſight of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
eyes, thoſe ſingular fauoures which
God had done her. This ſhe demanded with
ſuch teares, with ſuch gronings &amp; anxietie,
as ſhe obtained what ſhe deſired, in ſuch ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
that the very day of the Aſcenſion of
our Lord to heauen, our Lord tooke from
her theſe ſacred ſignes; hauing firſt ſaid to
her: Thou importuneſt me that I take away
that pretious gift which I gaue vnto thee, &amp;
I will do it: but being thou wilt not ſuffer
my roſes, I will giue thee my thornes, and a
thing that ſhall grieue thee more. And our
Lord fulfilling his worde, tooke from her
theſe ſignes, and gaue her to feele the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loures
of his paſſion in all the partes of her
body, much more painfull then before; For
although from the ſeauen, or eight yeares of
her age, our Lord had giuen her to feele
them, yet they had not beene ſo painfull to
her as they were from this day forward, as
the reuelations following do declare.</p>
               <p>4. Being eleuated in ſpirite by her good
Angell, in that place where he was wont to
place her, on friday the twentie two of Iune
before the day breake, our Lord repreſented
vnto her all the miſteries of his ſacred paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
ſo liuely, to her ſeeming, as if ſhe had
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:15857:94"/>
ſeene them on the mount of Caluarie at the
foote of the Croſſe, when Chriſt did ſuffer
them. His maieſtie alſo ſhewed her in a great
field, the martyrdome of Saint Acatius, and
his ten thouſand companions, how they were
crucified, and how our Lord from his owne
Croſſe did animate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſaying: Couragious
my frendes, behold me crucified, and dead
for you. She ſeing all this, asked of her An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
keeper, what it ment that Chriſt ſtood
crucified, and ſo many other crucified with
him; After that God made himſelfe man
(anſwered the Angell) he hath many compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
and thou alſo muſt be one, and parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
of the doloures of his paſſion, and of his
Croſſe, for ſo his maieſtie will haue it. And
that thou mighteſt ſee his ſacred paſſion, &amp;
the paſſions of ſo many of his ſeruants cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
with him, I brought thee to this place.
And our Lord looking vpon her, ſaide: wilt
thou daughter taſt of this fruit? Lord (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweared
ſhe) I will whatſoeuer thy maieſtie
will; and his maieſtie embracing her, left her
the doloures of his ſacred paſſion, and ſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uely
a feeling of them all, as the virgin ſaide,
that it ſeemed to her that they had driuen
burning nailes, through all the partes of her
body, and that ſhe heard a great noyſe, as if
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:15857:95"/>
with yron hammers they did driue and enforce
them into her fleſh.</p>
               <p>5. Another time being very ſicke a bed, there
appeared to her our holy Father S. Francis (vpon
his owne feaſt) glorious and bright, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
with many Saintes, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhe both ſawe, &amp;
ſpake vnto. The Seraphicall Father gaue her his
benediction, and the bleſſed virgin with much
humilitie and loue (hauing receiued it) asked it
for all the freers and nonnes of his order, and in
eſpeciall for thoſe of that holy conuent, beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
he would giue them all his bleſſing: The
holy Father did ſo, and taking his leaue of her,
becauſe ſhe was proſtrate at his ſacred feet, ſhe
kiſſed them, and he againe kiſt her head, ſaying<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
my daughter I will kiſſe the doloures of my
Lord Ieſus Chriſt, which by his mercy the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
maieſtie hath placed in thee.</p>
               <p>6. At the beginning of her great infirmities,
her doloures being moſt grieuous, it happened
her with the force of them to bee two or three
daies without rapte (a thing which was very
newe vnto her) and attributing it to her ſinnes,
ſhe thought that God for them handled her as
his enemie. Thinking vpon this, her good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
appeared to her, and ſayde: harken and heare
for our Lord will ſpeake to thee, and remember
what he ſhall ſay vnto thee. Forthwith our
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:15857:95"/>
Lord Ieſus Chriſt, appeared in a throne of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie,
accompanied with many Angells, and
ſpeaking to her with moſt ſweet and amorous
wordes, he ſaid: what doeſt thou, daughter, on
this bedd? ſhee anſwered (delighting her ſelfe
with him hauing firſt adored him) ô my Lord,
how do I ſuffer ſo many doloures, and yet thy
maieſtie doth not helpe me, neither doth my
ſoule enioy thy ſoueraigne cheriſhings, as it was
wont? our pious Lord anſwered; It is not much
that thou ſuffer doloures and infirmities ſeeing
thou art my eſpouſe, and haſt alſo choſen me
for thine, for I, in the time of my paſſion, was a
man of doloures. It is but iuſt, that who lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
truly, do partake of the doloures of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued.
A great fauour and grace is this for me,
replied the virgin: but how ô Lord do I find my
ſelfe ſo luke-warme as I am in thy loue, &amp; why
commandeſt thou not my Angell keeper, to
comfort me ſo oft as hee was wont? ſweet hart,
ſaid our Lord, where I am, there is comfort
and beatitude, and ſo, although thou be in this
bedd, this is thy heauen, for I am with thee
here. This ſaide, our Lord diſappeared, leauing
her much comforted, although ſomething con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded,
not knowing whether ſhee had ſeene
this viſion with the eies of her ſoule, or of her
body: but alwaies ſhee knew moſt certainly,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:15857:96"/>
that it was her redeemer who had appeared, and
ſpoken to her, and to take from her this doubt
he appeared to her the ſecond time, as ſhee her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
told it. Then ſhe remained not only ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
but much ſtrengthened, and with newe
courage to ſuffer the trauailes and paines of all
the world for his loue.</p>
               <p>7. Although our Lord ſo much cheriſhed
his eſpouſe, and had adorned her with the ſignes
of his ſacred paſſion, yet he ſtill kept her deafe,
which was in part the cauſe that ſhe liued in ſo
great ſinceritie as ſhe had bene a childe of a
yeare old, the which was a great diſcommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
not only for the religious of the howſe, but
alſo for other perſons abroad, which came to
communicate with her, and to confort them
ſelues, who hartely prayed our Lord he would
reſtore her her hearing, for the want they had
thereof. The diuine maieſtie heard their praiers,
appearing to his eſpouſe on the day of S. Clare
(it being ſix moneths that he had kept her deaf)
wherupon ſhe made a maruellous ſermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of many people, and declaring moſt great
miſteries, ſhe ſaide, that he had made her deafe
for that ſhe ſhould haue her ſenſes and thoughts
more recollected vpon the diuine maieſtie, and
on no other thing of the earth, and that now it
had pleaſed him to heale her. And ending the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:15857:96"/>
ſermon before ſhe came vnto her ſenſes, the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
S. Peter appeared to her, and putting his
fingers into her eares, and making vpon her the
ſigne of the Croſſe, he reſtored her her hearing,
and ſhee remained ſound, the religious giuing
much thancks to God for ſo remarkable a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour.</p>

               <p>1 THis holy virgin being Abbeſſe, with the
deſire ſhe had to exerciſe her religious in
the feare of God, ſhe told them many things of
thoſe which his maieſtie reuealed to her, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
his rigorous iudgement, the paines of
Purgatorie, and of hell. But it hath ſeemed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient
to leaue to relate many of them, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they be very conforme to the doctrine
of the Saints, and to a great multitude of exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
which are found in their bookes, yet are
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:15857:97"/>
they not written in the vulgar tongue, nor may

That which in rigour is deliuered in ſuch

to the ſchooles, then to be vſed in ſuch
a booke as this, which is written that it may
goe in the hands of all, of which many will find
a rocke of ſcandall, in that which well and
piouſly vnderſtood, is of much edification; as
the glorious Saint Gregorie, and other holy do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
rightly iudged, who of theſe matters and
apparitions of the ſoules, and ſpeciall places
where they purged their faultes, and of that
which had paſſed with them in diuine iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
ſet downe ſo many reuelations, made, not only
to them, but to perſons ſo vnequall in ſanctitie
and credit to the bleſſed Ioane, that they were
holden for grieuous ſinners, and God our Lord
did them this great fauour to reueale them theſe
like things; that taking heed by others mens
harmes, they might feare the rigour of his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
and haue confidence in his diuine mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</p>
               <p>2. With the ſame deſire this bleſſed Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſſe
in the chapters and ſpeaches which ſhe
made to her religious, did exhort them, recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them many reuelations which ſhe had had
of God, and with notable ſpirite, ſaide as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:15857:97"/>
when ſhe related them: Thincke not ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
that the paines of hell, and Purgatorie are
but little, for by only thinking on that which
our Lord doth ſhew me ſometimes my fleſh tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth,
and I am driuen euen to the very ſtraites
of death. She further recounted what paſſed
with a ſoule, when it was taken out of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
aſwell with the supreame iudge as with, the
Angell keeper of the ſame: and in eſpeciall when
it heard the terrible ſentence of euerlaſting glory
or paine. And although of theſe things the
bookes of the Saints be full, and of theſe appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Chriſt our Lord in the particular iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of euery one (which are to be vnderſtood,
not according to his reall preſence, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his efficacie and virtue) they are not
written here, not to giue occaſion of erring. For
the greater declaration therfore of ſome things
heere related, of many which are found in the
booke of the life of this ſeruant of God, it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
conuenient to note ſome of them, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that which I ſhall note, is not moſt eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
knowen to the learned, and to many of
thoſe which haue not ſtudied, for as much as
they are found in euery manuall, but becauſe
none may haue occaſion of errour.</p>
               <p>3. I ſay then firſt, that in the houre of death,
euery one heareth his ſentence of condemnation
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:15857:98"/>
or libertie, according as is gathered out of many
places of the ſacred ſcripture, and out of the
holy Fathers, as appeareth in Eccleſiaſticus, in
S. Mathew, and in S. Luce: S. Auguſtine alſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth
as much, together with Saint Hierom,
and Saint Bonauenture: although concerning
the manner, and how it ought to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
there be diuers opinions; whereupon
Pope Innocent the third wrote at large in his
ſecond booke: and Landulphus the Carthuſian
in the fourty ſix chapter of the third tome. Who
all relate ſome caſes very like to thoſe which
befell to the B. Ioane. But where it is ſaid, that
euery one heareth this ſentence of Chriſt our
Lord, it ought to bee vnderſtood as is alreadie
ſaide, not according to his reall preſence, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his efficacie. (<hi>Eccl. 11. Matth. 10. &amp; 22.
Luc. 16. D. Aug. de ciuit. Dei lib. 20. cap. 1. &amp; de anima
&amp; eius origine lib. 2. cap. 4. S. Hierom. in Ioel. cap. 2.
S. Bonauent. lib. 4. ſent. dist. 20. 1. p. q.</hi> 5.)</p>
               <p>4. The ſecond, that as little improprietie it
hath to ſay with the ſame declaration, that the
glorious Archangell S. Michaell doth iudge in
particular the ſoules after they are gone out of
the bodies, as the Church ſingeth, when in his
office ſhe ſaith to God, that he conſtituteth him
prince ouer all ſoules: and the ſame ſhe reprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
in the proſe of the Maſſe of the dead. (<hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitui

te principem ſuper omnes animas ſuſcipiendas.
Signifer ſanctus Michael, repreſentes eas in Lucem
Sanctam.</hi>)</p>
               <p>5. The third and moſt principall which we
haue in this matter, is, that the Saints ſpeake
therin after two manners: the one according to
the Common Lawe, which is that ordinarilie
is executed: and the other according to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
caſes which God reuealeth to them. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
whereof, it is ſo, that there is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
place which is called Purgatorie, where re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly
the ſoules are purged with paine correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondent
to the faultes which they committed,
and ſatisfied not in their life time: and there are
alſo particular places, where God ordeyneth
that they ſatisfie, as teacheth S. Thomas with
all the Doctors, in eſpeciall S. Gregorie. (<hi>S. Tho.
in 4. D. 21. q. 1. a. 1. ad 3. S. Bonau. in 4. D. 20. 1. p. q. 6.
S. Antonin 3. p. hist. tit.</hi> 33. §. 3. <hi>S. Greg. lib. 4. Dialog.
cap. 40. and</hi> 55.)</p>
               <p>6. Likewiſe the common opinion is, that
in Purgatorie neither the Angells, nor the diuels
doe torment the ſoules, but only the diuine iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
by meanes of the fire of Purgatorie, as teach
S. Thomas, and Scotus, with all ſchoole diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.
Yet for all this it is no leſſe manifeſt &amp; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
that ſometimes the diuells do torment

               <p>7. The fourth thing, that concerneth the
terribleneſſe and duration, of the paines of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie,
and the great valour of the ſuffrages of
the Church, and interceſſion of the iuſt, we find
in many of the Saints bookes ſome things very
great and of greater note, then that which hath
beene reuealed to this B. virgin. Saint Thomas
pondereth the greatneſſe of the paines, and ſaint

that his Siſter Francis Ferrer, was in Purgatorie
condemned to the paines therof vntill the end

which was condemned to the paines of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie,

Victore, and Belarmine affirme the ſame of
others. (<hi>Beda hist. Angliae lib. 5. cap. 3. Belarm. tom.
1. de Purgatorio libro</hi> 2.) And although other
authors do limit this very much, iudging
that at moſt a ſoule may be in Purgatorie
for the ſpace of ten yeares, yet they deſerue
not ſo rigorous ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſure as thoſe who impugne

the Angells keepers carry the ſoules to Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie,
and comfort them, as the Saints do ſay,
to many of whom our Lord hath permitted,
that ſoules which were in paine ſhould appeare,
(<hi>S. Bonauen. lib. 4. ſent. dist. 2. in 1. p. q.</hi> 5.) that in
their praiers they might be commended, and
that others in ſpirite might ſee Purgatorie, and
the rigorous paines which in ſo many manners
the ſoules did there ſuffer; (<hi>S. Thom. ibi. dist. 21. q.

and taking pitty vpon them, they might
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:15857:100"/>
beware by others harmes. The ſame happened
to the B. Ioane many times: and among others
being ſacriſtian, and ringing one night to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,
ſhe heard very ſorrowfull grones as of
ſome perſon that bewailed: and asking of her
Angell keeper, what voices thoſe were, he ſaide;
They are of a ſoule, in great neceſſitie, which
by the licence of God, commeth to commend it
ſelfe by thy prayers. This was the ſoule of a
great Lady of Caſtile (who died a little before)
which ſaid to B. Ioane, that in as much as her
paines were moſt grieuous, ſhe entreated her
ſhe would co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend her to God, and alſo to pray
her mother, to helpe her with certaine almes &amp;
maſſes: of theſe caſes many happened to her, and
ſhe ſaid, that ſhe ſawe in purgatorie certaine
places darke, moſt fearfull and filthie, and
the diuells which very cruellie tormented ſome
ſoules, to the which for euery fault they gaue
different paines, and that the ſoules gaue many
grones, ſaying: woe to vs, which had time to
ſerue God, and did not do it; now we are tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented,
and contrition auaileth vs not, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
               <p>10. I ſawe by the will of God (ſaid ſhe on
a time to her religious) the ſoule of a certaine
Prelate in purgatorie, which ſuffered much
paine: and I demanding the cauſe therof of my
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:15857:101"/>
holy Angell, he ſaide to me, that that ſoule was
of a prelate, which for hauing beene careleſſe of
the ſoules of his ſubiects, ſuffered great paines
for the faultes he did in the ſeruice of God, and
for thoſe which his ſubiects did by his occaſion
and euill example.</p>
               <p>11. This bleſſed woman knewe that a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
Eccleſiaſticall perſon (of whom herſelfe
had receiued particular aggrieuances) of much
authoritie, was dead. And as ſhe was a friend of
doing good for euill, ſhe did not ceaſe to pray to
God to haue mercie of his ſoule: making ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
her prayer for him, he appeared to her one
night in a figure very fearfull &amp; filthie. He bare
in his mouth a gagge, &amp; his cloathing was very
miſerable and poore: he went vpon his hand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and feet like a beaſt, &amp; being he could not make
his complaint, he roared like a Bull, and he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
about him all the ſinnes which he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
againſt God, and ſome ſoules which by
his euill example, had beene condemned, were
put to paines vpon his backe: he carried alſo vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
him, a great troupe of diuells on horsbacke,
which caſt in his teeth his ſinnes, and gaue him
many blowes and buffets: and taking the gagge
out of his mouth, they put in it a hallow tru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ck,
by the which iſſued a voice ſo terrible, that at
the only hearing of it, the B. Ioane was excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:15857:101"/>
ſorowfull, although much more for that
ſhe knewe not if his paines were of Purgatorie
or of hell: which deſirous to knowe, ſhe asked
it of her Angell keeper: who anſweared her;
God in time will reueale it to thee. And ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuering
in her prayer, ſhe praied our Lord he
would take pitty, of the paines of that ſoule, and
remember ſome good worckes which it had
done in this life; But not knowing any other
which in particular ſhe might alleadge in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour,
ſhe ſaide: Lord I knowe that this man
was ſo deuout to a Saint, that being in this life
he cauſed his image to bee painted, and had
much deuotion to it, for the which I beſeech
thy maieſtie, that taking pitty vpon his ſoule,
thou wilt deliuer it from the paines which it
ſuffereth.</p>
               <p>12. So long ſhe perſeuered in praier to God
for this ſoule, that ſome daies being paſſed
ouer, ſhe ſawe enter in at the doore of her cell, a
moſt fierce bull which bare betweene his hornes
the image of the Saint, which that man had cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to be painted, and he came along by it, as it
were helping him ſelfe by the image: &amp; looking
toward the ſeruant of our Lord, ſaid: I am ſuch
an one, for whom thou ſo much haſt praied, &amp;
for thy merites, God hath done me great mercy
and gaue me this image for my comforte and
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:15857:102"/>
defenſe, which is the ſame that I cauſed to be
painted of the Saint to which I was deuout, the
which doth much help me in this labour: our
Lord lighten thy paines, chriſtian ſoule, ſaid the
ſeruant of God, for thou haſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forted me ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently,
by reaſon I deſired ſo much to know, if
thou wert in the way of ſaluation, for the other

as I could not diſcerne it. Be not amazed
(anſweared the ſoule) for my paines haue beene
very great: and if I had none other but thoſe of
this oxe on which I goe, they were moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous,
for on him I haue the paine of thirſt, hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
fire, and cold. And this ſaide he asked her
pardon of many aggreuances which in this life
he had done her, and ſaide: that the deuotion
which ſome time he had had to her, holpe him
much: and with this he vaniſhed. Whom ſhe
neuer left to pray to God for, viſiting him, and
comforting him in purgatorie, vntill our Lord
by her prayers tooke him from thoſe paines.</p>

her great patience.</head>
               <p>1 BY a reuelation made to this ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of our
Lord, it was knowen, that God had cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
her to make her very like to his only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Sonne in laboures, perſecutions, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graces.
And ſhe deſiring to haue in her ſoule all
ſuch Iewells which ſo much pleaſe God, asked
of his maieſtie in all her praiers, with much hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie
&amp; teares, that he would giue her paines,
laboures, wearineſſe and doloures to ſuffer for
his loue. Our Lorde heard her praier, and gaue
her them in ſo great plentie as ſhe could deſire,
which manifeſted well the powerfull hand of
him who gaue them, by the multitude which
came vpon her, being tormented with very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſiue
doloures, which ſhe had in her head, ſo
great as there was no phyſitia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> found, that could
vnderſtand what they were: and thoſe daies that
ſhe had them, it was with ſuch rigor, that ſhe
could nether eate, nor ſleepe, nor get downe a
draft of water, nor yet open her mouth to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine.
They endured her foureteene yeares,

               <p>2. To theſe ſo great doloures, were added

that they changed her habit, her tunicke, &amp; the
cloathes of her bed, fiue or ſix times a day. Theſe
ſweates were as cold as yee, and endured her
twentie, and thirtie daies, without ceaſing, and
with ſo many doloures and euills, our Lord ſent
her others very great and more continuall; for
her armes and handes, knees, legges, and feet
were drawen together in ſuch ſort, as ſhe could
neuer more open them nor ſtretch them out, &amp;
with the great force of the paines, all her mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
were out of iointe: ſo that many of them
remained, not only cripled, and lame, but alſo
wreſted, turned aſide, and thruſt out of their
places: and in this ſort and manner her bodie, is
at this day, according as heereafter we ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare.</p>
               <p>3. The bleſſed Abbeſſe, finding herſelfe one
day much tired with the troope of laboures
which attended her, and with much weakeneſſe
of her infirmities, her corporall forces now fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:15857:104"/>
and her griefes abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, lifted vp her eies
to an image of the praier of our Lord in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
which ſhe had by her at her beddes head: &amp;
ſheding ſome teares, ſhee prayed our Lord to
help her in the vexations, &amp; laboures which ſhe
awayted. And being in this praier, ſhe heard a
voice which ſaide to her: our Lord is with thee,
and will that thou ſuffer great doloures and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes,
&amp; that the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of thy body bee cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled,

And ſo was this ſeruant of our Lord made a see
of griefe, and an abyſſe of reuelations.</p>
               <p>4. The diuine maieſtie willing, to manifeſt
to the world the patience and ſanctitie of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant,
permitted to come vpon her a perſecution
which the diuell plotted, taking for inſtrument
ſome of her owne religious: in the which the

                  </gap> need of no ſmall
portion to ſuffer ſuch like tribulations, which
although light and not of ſo great ſubſtance in
themſelues, yet are much felt, becauſe of the
offenſe of God in thoſe that procure them: and
in this was alſo ioyned very great ingratitude for
ſo many benefits as the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t had alwaies recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
of ſo inculpable a Prelate. The occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was,
that the Lord Cardinall freer Francis Simenes
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:15857:105"/>
hauing done a grace to the conuent, of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing
on it the benefice of Cubas, a certaine
perſon which pretended therto, procured to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
the ſame from Rome, at the death of him
that had it in poſſeſſion, and they counſelled the
ſeruant of God ſhe ſhould procure of his holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
a perpetuall confirmation of that which
the Cardinall had granted temporally. This was
done by meanes of one deuout to the ſaide mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſterie,
and the Bull was obtained, in virtue
wherof at this day the nonnes poſſeſſe the afor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
benefice: in getting of which Bull, was
ſpent ſome quantitie of money. The fact was
this, and the circumſtances which therin might
be conſidered of ſo little co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration, as would
hardly be thought, for they would haue done
it without conſulting with the Prelate, and to
ſpend that money without her licence, or any
religious contradicting it. And howſoeuer it
bee, I found not in the bookes of the life of this
ſeruant of God, more then this ſpoken of.</p>
               <p>5. And yet on the other ſide, the ſucceſſe
was terrible. For firſt of all the Superior ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
her, and after corrected her and depriued
her of her office, and placed in it the vicareſſe
which had accuſed her: and being the ſeruant
of God had ſuch credit before, hereby occaſion
was giuen, that many ſpake diuerſly of her, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:15857:105"/>
in doubt the great maruailes which before
were related of her, holding it morally impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
that the religious which had great expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience

                  </gap>ie, and
not doubting of her, could inuent ſuch like per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution
againſt her: And aboue all, it made the
caſe hard, that the ſuperiour ſhould take ſuch a
reſolution againſt a perſon of ſuch credite, for
it was as much as to ſet a ſeale to a blancke, to
the end that each one might put therin what
pleaſed him. That which I belieue of the caſe
is, that the ſuperiour did it in policie, for to
proue this ſeruant of God in all manners For
wheras the thinges publiſhed of her, were ſo
ſtrange and admirable, and the diuell ſo ſubtill,
it was not contrarie to prudence to refine her in
all manners. But howſoeuer it was, God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

out of it much profit in fauour and praiſe of his
ſeruant. For firſt of all was ſeene not only her
patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, but the great quietude of her conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
in the equalitie and alacritie wherwith ſhe bare
this trauaile, iudging her ſelfe not only worthie
of this, but alſo of many others greater. She
ſhewed alſo her feruent charitie, in praying to
God for her that perſecuted her: for whom ſhe
obtained pardon of her faulte by the earneſt
praier ſhe made: for our Lord chaſtiſing her
with temporall paine, ſhe died in the ſame office
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:15857:106"/>
within ſhort time of a great paine of the ſide.
And acknowledging her faulte, ſhe demanded
publickely pardon of the ſeruant of God with
great teares, and hauing receiued the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts,
with great ſhewes of contrition, ſhe gaue vp
the Ghoſt, of which the nonnes admiring, were
confirmed a new in the great good opinion
which they had of their bleſſed Abbeſſe.</p>
               <p>6. A little before this ſucceeded, on friday
before the day breake, this ſeruant of our Lord
ſawe, (his maieſtie ſhewing it her) hell open, &amp;

her to write the things which our
Lord did reueale vnto her, and of
her glorious death.</head>
               <p>1 SO great is the charitie of God, and
ſuch his mercy, that ſeeldom times ho
doth ſo ſpeciall fauoures (as thoſe which
haue beene ſeene in this hiſtorie) to any one
for himſelfe alone, but by meanes therof to
profit many others. And hence it is, that her
Angell keeper ſo oftentimes comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded the
ſeruant of God B. Ioane, to write the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
and fauoures which God did to her. For
ſhe with womanly modeſtie, and through
her great humilitie, was aſhamed for to
write them. Which not to do, nor proſecute,
what was begunne, ſhe propoſed a thouſand
infirmities euery day, alleaging thoſe of her
little health, and her being ſo ſtiffe in the
handes, as ſhe could hardly write her name,
as appeareth by ſome papers and writings
found which ſhe wrote while ſhe was Abbeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe.
Wherupon the Angell commanded her
ſhe ſhould write no more with her owne
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:15857:107"/>
hand, but that ſhe ſhould cauſe them to be
written by the hand of another of the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,
which was to her another labour, grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then the former was; and therfore refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
it as much as ſhe could, ſhee ſaide: Sir
the fauoures which God hath done me (and
the things which your beautie hath told me)
haue beene all in ſecret, and writing them
by another hand, they cannot chooſe but
be publiſhed. And fearing it, and the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of men, being ſo perſecuted as ſhe
was, and as other religious of the conuent
were alſo for her ſake, ſhe ſaide to the Angell:
ſir if hereupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there ſhould befall ſome great
euill to my ſiſters and to me, what ſhould we
doe? God hath care of them and of thee (ſaide

doth thee ſhall ceaſe, and thy doloures and
perſecutions ſhall be augmented more then
thou artable to thincke.</p>
               <p>2. She hearing this with humilitie and
feare obeying the Angell, beganne to write
by the hand of another religious, called ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:15857:108"/>
Marie Euangeliſt, who according to the
tradition of the conuent, and as is manifeſt
by an information made with ſworne witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
which knewe her and many times heard
her ſay it: neither knewe how to reade, nor
write, vntill our Lord miraculouſly granted
her this grace to write the booke of the Carde
(as aforſaide) and ſo ſhe wrote with much
certaintie, the life and miracles of this B.
virgin. Thoſe two bookes haue beene holden
and are holden in the conuent as reliques of
much eſteeme, giuing help againſt tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes,
and thunders, and many infirmities.
They are both very olde, and at this day liue
three religious, which knewe her that wrote
them, and heard her tell it many times, and
they affirme that ſhe was a nunne of good
life very penitent and of much praier, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation,
and that after her death ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to another religious, in the Church,
with much ſplendor, and with a booke of
Gold in her hands open which was that ſhee
wrote of the things of the glorious Ioane.
The ſeruant of our Lord grieued much to
ſee that the writing was neuer made an end
of, and howe faire and ſoftly the nunne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
in her writing: wherfore a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the laſt infirmitie tooke her, of which
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:15857:108"/>
ſhe died, ſhe praied her Angell keeper, he
would be content with that was written, and
not oblige her to more, he granted it her
with good will, and ſaide: bid thy ſiſter that
her pen ceaſe, and ſhe write no more. With
this licence of the Angell, the ſeruant of
God hauing what ſhe deſired, was bold to
ſay: ſir if it ſhould pleaſe the ſiſters, it would
be to me much comfort, that what is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
ſhould be torne. God forgiue thy preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(anſwered the Angell) and do by and by
penance therof, for thou haſt offended him
with this euill thought: With this ſhe tooke
her leaue of her Angell, and bid the ſiſter
ſhe ſhould leaue wrighting.</p>
               <p>3. To the many infirmities which ſhe had,
our Lord ſent her the laſt, which was a ſtto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
euill of her vrine, whereby ſhe was driuen
to great ſtraites, with moſt grieuous paines,
and was fifteene daies together without
paying to nature her accuſtomed tribute.
And although in all her infirmities ſhe had
marueilous patience, in this which was the
laſt, ſhe had a thouſand times more and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded

when the phyſitian
came to viſite her, ſhe
entreated him to take
no more paines about
her, for the will of
our Lord was, that
ſhe ſhould die of that
infirmitie. This was
by and by knowen in

and cherinſhings from heauen, as it ſeemeth
the diuine maieſtie would ſeale vp in her death,
the great fauoures which he had done in the

               <p>5. Firſt of all, on friday the firſt of May,

the ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God being in her ſenſes, ſawe
with her bodilie eies certaine viſions, of the
which ſhe would tell none, although the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
did entreat it of her. The night of the

how careleſſe haue I beene! And that night ſhe
was many times rapte, and entring into the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonie
of death ſhe entred into the laſt battaile
with the enemie of mankind, as another S. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larion
(according as they ſawe and vnderſtood
who were preſent, and as was manifeſt by thoſe
things which ſhe ſaide) for ſometimes ſhe held
her peace, other times ſhe anſweared; and as if
ſhe had ſpoken with another perſon, ſhe ſaide:
O what a cruell ſword! hold him, hold him, let
him not kill me with it. And a little while after,
ſhe ſaide: Call her to me, call her to me, ſhe
goeth away. And asking her whom ſhe would
they ſhold call. She anſweared, the bleſſed Saint
Magdalen. Then ſhe reſted a little, &amp; after with
much affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſaide. Let vs goe mother of God,

this ſhe ſaide with notable hart and courage, caſt
him hence, caſt him hence.</p>
               <p>6. It hapned that in this battell and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict,
the Saints left her (our Lord permitting it)
that alone ſhe might ouercome in death, him
whom ſo often ſhe had ouercome in life. All the
time that this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bate dured (which was a great
while) ſhe lamented much, ſaying: Oh in what
an ill time haſt thou left me! and after ſhe ſaide?
Lord haſt thou left me alone? goe to, caſt hence
this diuell, for he hath no part in me, euill goe
with him. And turning to the religious, ſhe ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de:

with other perſons ſhe beganne to ſay: ſeeke me
him out, ſeeke me my Lord Ieſus Chriſt. Let
him find me and I will finde him. Wherfore haue
you carried him from me? let me alone, I will
goe to ſee him, although I am all diſioynted.
The religious asked her whom ſhe would they
ſhould ſeeke? and ſhee ſaide<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> my Lord; Why
where ſhall we find him, mother? In the garden
anſwered the bleſſed maide, and as it were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
for griefe, with a great ſighe ſhe ſaide:
Ah mother of God? Ieſus, what crueltie, what
crueltie my Lord, let thy mercy exceed thy iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.
Ieſus, what anguiſh, and turning her face
to the religious, much afflicted ſhe ſaide: help

me to pray. And ſtopped with the word in her
mouth, the nonnes much afflicted ſaide: what
will you mother that wee help you to pray for?
ſhe anſweared: that mercy may exceed iuſtice.
After this very merrie, ſhe beganne to ſay: let

and this ſhe repeated many times.</p>
               <p>7. The phyſitian who aſſiſted at her beddes

may bee, and with all this ſhe had beene foure
howers without pulſe, and three daies without
eating. Then lifting vp her voice, againe ſhe
ſaide: my frendes carrie me away, carrie me by

and ſhe anſwered: with the Saints and virgins.
They ſaide to her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> why with whom will you

bring me againe, bring me againe my Queene

were there, ſhe ſaide: yea and my Angells, and
my Saints; and ſhe ſaide: let vs goe my Lady,

moſt great alacritie: make him place here at my
ſide iuſt by me. And a little after ſhe ſaide with
great reuerence: O my Father! And the religious
thought ſhe ſpake to her Father Saint Francis.
And although they had beene wearied with the
ſick partie all the ſaturday night, yet it ſeemed
not a moment to them: and the holy morning
of the ſunday comming, ſhe ſaide: why then
ſweet Ieſus, let vs goe hence my Lord, let vs
goe quickly, let vs goe my redemer. Then the
religious ſeeing their comfort was going away,
and their ſunne ſetting, made proceſſions praiers,
and diſciplines, praying God he would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue
them of ſo great a good, but giue health
to their B. Mother. All of them kiſſed her hand,
and ſhe bleſſed the preſent and abſent, and all
that were deuoted to her. And againe ſhe ſaide:
let vs goe Lord, my Redemer, let vs goe from
hence: they asked her if our Lord were there,
ſhe ſaide, yea, and alſo his moſt holy mother.</p>
               <p>8. On the ſaturday morning came the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian,
and ſaide to the ſicke partie: it ſeemeth
to me mother, that you are going from vs to
heauen; tell vs who accompanieth you in the
way. My Lady the virgin Marie, and my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
keeper, and my Angells and my Saints, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
ſhee: and her face by and by became ſo

faire and ſo reſplendent, as when ſhe was wont
to be in raptes, and hauing had till that time a
very vnſauorie breath, cauſed by her infirmitie,
from that time ſo much ſweetneſſe and fragran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
came out of her mouth, as it ſeemed ſome
heauenlie thing. And a little while after, with
newe feruour and ſpirit, as if ſhe ſpake with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
perſons ſhe ſaide; happy tydings, ſalute me
with happy tydings. And this ſhe ſaide with
ſuch alacritie, that thoſe which ſtood there, iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
that her celeſtiall ſpouſe adorned now that
holy ſoule, with the Iewells of her eſpouſall.
The bleſſed maide remained full of that ſweet
ſmell, and her face moſt reſplendent, and her
lippes, carnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> redd as corall, with ſuch quiet,
and alacritie as was admirable. And ſo ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
not ſpeaking a word from ſaturday vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
ſunday after euenſong, the day of the Inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

tooke the habit, &amp; was profeſſed. On this happy
day at ſix of clocke in the euening, reading the

at fiftie and three yeares of her age, &amp; at fourtie
of her conuerſion to the order.</p>
               <p>9. Thoſe that ſtood about her remained with
much maruaile at the peace, quietude and ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critie
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:15857:112"/>
with which ſhe rendred vp her ſoule to her
Creator; the rather for hauing vnderſtood by
her wordes, the great force of her doloures,
which at that time her many infirmities cauſed
her, and the ſtrong conflict which ſhe had with
the diuell (a thing which our Lord permitted
to happen, to other Saints, as to Saint Martin,
Saint Hilarion, &amp;c.) that they ſhould ſee ſo great

virtue and ſanctitie to our glorious Ioane, and
both of them ſo great frendes, that being ſo
farre a ſunder they communed together many
times in ſpirite. And the proofe which for ſome
of theſe caſes was had, doth add more credit to
that which this ſeruant of God teſtified of the

Foure daies after her death, ſhe appeared to her,

left two crouches with which he we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Likewiſe
a ſicke religious which had a very great ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and many paines, touching the dead body,
was healed. The ſame ſucceeded to another
man, who had a great paine in his teeth. The
proceſſion in which they carried the holy body
to the ſepulture, returning to the conuent, they
found meſſingers with letters from great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
who demanded to haue the buriall differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:15857:114"/>
vntill they ſhould come, for they were nowe
in the way. And ſo they detained her fiue daies
vnburied; that moſt ſweet odor of which we
haue ſpoken, alwaies proceeding from the dead
body.</p>
               <p>2. The people that came from Madrid, from
Toledo, as alſo from diuers other places were
ſo many, that they couered the fieldes, for which
cauſe, and for to auoide the diſturbance, which
was great, they determined to commit that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
treaſure to the earth, burying her without
coffin, or any thing elſe of defence that might
conſerue her entire: but rather after they had
couered her with earth, they caſt a great quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of water vpon the ſepulture, as ordinarily the
cuſtome is. And although it ſeemeth to haue
beene want of conſideration, and a kinde of ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deneſſe,
hauing experienced ſo great maruaills,
it was ſurely a particular inſtinct of God, that ſo
much the better his power might be manifeſted,
in that which afterward was ſeene when the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
body was tranſlated; which hauing beene
vnder ground ſeauen yeares, at the end wherof,
very graue Ladies which had beene deuoted to
the ſeruant of God, making great inſtance, and
ineſpeciall the Lady Do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>na Iſabell de Mendoça,
the wife of Don Gonzalo Chacon, Lord of the
towne of Caſarrubios of the hill, conſultation
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:15857:114"/>
was held of placing the bones of the glorious
Ioane in a more decent place, (whoſe ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and miracles were ſo notorious) wherupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
there was made an arche at the right ſide of
the high altar, in the wall which diuideth
the chancell from the cloiſter of the mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie,
where a hollowe hole was left, of two
yardes in a highe place and eminent, wherin
might be contained a gilden cheſt, which
the ſaide Lady Iſabell had commanded to
be made, with two ſtrong grates, one of the
ſide of the chapell, and another of the ſide
of the cloiſter, that without perill, as well
the religious, as the ſeculars, might enioy of
the reliques of the ſeruant of God.</p>
               <p>3. This done, the ſepulture was opened,
making accoumpt that the body was now
reſolued into aſhes: which yet was found ſo
entire, ſo freſh, &amp; with ſo ſweete a ſauour,
as when it was firſt buried. All being amaſed
at the ſight, their deuotion encreaſed, and
the habit wherwith ſhe had beene enterred,
was deuided into reliques, and they veſted
her with another of ſad colored damask.
And laying her in the ſaide cheſt, with great
veneration, it was put in the place aboue
mentioned, with the grates of yron very
ſtrong and guilded, and a lampe of ſiluer
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:15857:115"/>
which burneth before the holy body: where
it is much worſhipped, not only of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the countrey, but of many others alſo
who come to viſite it, from very remote and
farre places performing there their nouenas.
On the day that this bleſſed woman dyed,
the towne of Cubas celebrateth her feaſt,
with great deuotion, and goeth in proceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to the monaſterie, with other of the adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
townes, and highe maſſe is ſunge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the body, on a portatible altar, which
to this effect is ſet vp. The excellencies of
the ſeruant of God are preached, and the
towne giueth bread, and wine, and cheeſe,
to innumerable people which repaire thither
againſt that day. And the deuotion encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
in the people, through particular bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
which they haue receiued of the ſeruant
of God, they haue offered to her nine lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes
of ſiluer, which burne day and night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
her body, wherwith ſhe is had in great
veneration.</p>
               <p>4. Since the ſaide tranſlation, it is not
knowen that the cheſt hath beene opened,
vntill the yeare one thouſand fiue hundred

ſuch diſpoſition through all, as cauſed in
the beholders notable admiration.</p>
               <p>5. And although the ſaide teſtimonies
be of ſufficient authoritie, to prooue our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
albeit the holy body had beene af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:15857:116"/>
diſſolued, as it hath ſucceeded in the
bodies of other Saintes, which for ſome time
our Lord conſerued without corruption mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly,
and afterward were diſſolued, yet to
proue the incorruptibilitie of the body of this
ſeruant of God, there is little neceſſitie of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
teſtimonies, for all ceaſſeth with the eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
which at this day we haue before our
eies. When being eightie yeares ſince ſhe died
it lieth with the ſame integritie freſhneſſe and
faireneſſe, with which they found it when it
was tranſlated after it had lyen in the bare earth
ſeauen yeares together. The firſt time that in
theſe daies it was diſcouered, certaine things
ſucceeded worthie of memorie, which I will
relate, becauſe they are very graue perſons and
all aliue, which were then preſent.</p>
               <p>6. In the beginning of the yeare 1601.
came to Madrid the moſt reuerend Father freer
Francis de Soſa, the firſt time after he had beene
choſen miniſter generall of our ſacred Religion,
hauing beene there ſome daies, he departed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Toledo, with determination to dine at
Grinnon, and to take his reſt in the conuent of
Oliua, and the next day to come to Toledo.
Departing out of Grinnon, immediatly after
dinner, becauſe it was cloudie, hauing gone a
little more then a quarter of a league, the clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:15857:116"/>
were diſperſed, and the ſunne ſcorched,
and therfore their iourney being ſhort, he
would returne to Grinnon. And the Father
freer Peter Gonzales de Mendoza, who this
day is the moſt worthie Archbiſhopp of
Grannada, and then was Prouinciall &amp; went
in companie of the ſaide Father Generall,
tould him, that it would be better to goe
to the conuent of the Croſſe, which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the ſame diſtance, and he ſhould ſee
that monaſterie, before the ſetting of the
Sunne. They did ſo, and after that Father
generall had beene receiued with the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed
ceremonie of bringing him to the
quire in proceſſion, and the religious had
taken his benediction, and he hauing made
them a ſpirituall exhortation, as the cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
is, he went to the infirmarie, where the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
was a very ancient religious woman, who
had beene at the laſt tranſlation of the body
of the bleſſed ſiſter Ioane of the Croſſe; The
Father talked with her a good while, of
thinges concerning the bleſſed, Saint, and
where her body was, vntill it was time to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte.</p>
               <p>7. Paſſing along the cloiſter, where the
window was which goeth to the ſaide ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
by chance Father Generall ſaide, that
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:15857:117"/>
hee could be glad it were not ſo late, that he
might call wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ckmen to open the grate, and
take downe the cheſt, to ſee that which the
ancient nonne had related to him. And ſuch
was the inſtance, which aſwell the religious
which accompanied Father Generall, as the
nonnes of the conuent made (that although
it ſeemed to little purpoſe, it being nowe
late, and no worckmen at hand, nor inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
ſuch as were neceſſarie) the ſaide Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Generall ſuffered himſelfe to be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.
And ſeeking ladders, and hammers,
he himſelfe being the firſt at worcke, with
much a doe they tooke away the grate, for
it was great, and heauie, and garniſhed with
very great coſt. Afterward they tooke downe
the arcke wherin the bleſſed body was; but
vnder it they did not find the keyes, which
were not there, where the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne affirmed they
had beene put. And becauſe they would not
breake the lockes, they vnnailed three bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es
of iron, and carried the cheſt in proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to the quier of the nonnes, where they
opened it, and with great admiration of all,
they found the holy Body entire, and freſh.
The ſeruant of God was veſted with a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
of ſad coloured Damask, with two very
white attires vpon her head, (for when ſhee
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:15857:117"/>
dyed the nonnes had not the blacke veile) ſhe
had a Croſſe in her hande, and a little ſtring of
beades of orange about her necke. And all with
great conſolation and many teares worſhipped
the holy Body, and they brought it to the grate,
that the people which were there might ſee it.
It was a marueillous thing to ſee, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent
ſtanding in a deſert, and the reſolution of
opening the arck hauing beene ſodenly taken in
hand, yet the Church was as full of people, as if
it had beene publiſhed in all the prouince for
many daies before. Father Generall tooke away
the kercher from the head of the ſeruant of God,
and the orange beades which ſhe had about her
necke, and diuided them among the freers and
nonnes. And taking from one of thoſe that ſtood
by her veile, and another ſtring of beades, put
them vpon the bleſſed Ioane.</p>
               <p>8. Shutting vp the arcke, and calling worck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
to put it in the place againe, he tooke his
way toward the conuent of Oliua; where tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
with the Religious, of that which had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
they noted one thing, which before they
had not conſidered, and this it was. The ſeruant
of God deſired much in her life time, that her
nonnes ſhold vowe encloaſure, &amp; take the veile:
and not hauing obtained the ſecond in her life,
ſhe obtained it of our Lord after her death, in
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:15857:118"/>
ſuch ſort, as now all the religious hauing the
blacke veile, ſhe alone had it white in her ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
And becauſe to veile the nonnes, is to be
the act of a Prelate and Superior by Apoſtolicall
priuiledge, God brought the moſt reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
of all the order to the ſaide monaſterie, ſo
vnthought of and by chance: who without mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſſed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſſed,
it being the firſt time that he had come
to the ſaide prouince, after his election, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he had exerciſed the principall actes of his
iuriſdiction therein. For then he went to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
the Prouinciall chapter, God hauing deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
him in Madrid from a perilous infirmitie.
And more, the ſame day alſo ſucceeded a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueilous
thing, that Father Generall taking from
the ſaide body the little toe of one foote, it was
apparent afterward, that bloud had iſſued out of
it, as was ſeene by the cloathes which ſhe had
on: although at that time it was not marked, for
that the ſaide Father Generall tooke the toe in
ſecret, pulling it off with his hand. Since that
time the cheſt hath beene opened diuers times,
the teſtimonies being co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued of the incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibilitie
of the ſaide body, which are kept in the

to whom they giue no

it is manifeſt that
it is verie difficult to
interprete as the Regall
Prophet ſaith in many
places: and ſpecially.
In the 118. Pſalme, and

                  <p>To proue this we neede ſpend little time, for
to themſelues it is manifeſt, that the ſects are
innumerable which daily they inuent, and their
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:15857:127"/>

appeareth when Oſiander confuteth Philip Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancthon
(<hi>Oſiander in confutatione aduerſus Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippum</hi>)
who affirmeth that there were propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the confeſſioniſtes, twenty contrarie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,
in the matter only of iuſtification. The
ſame doth Luther (<hi>Luther<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> contra. Zing.) Oecolam.</hi>
againſt Zuinglius, Oecolampadius, and vpon
the Pſalmes: and in the booke of councells, he
confeſſeth concerning the obſcurity of the ſacred
ſcripture, that which he denyeth in the ſaide
booke againſt the articles of Pope Leo. Finally
there can be no greater blindneſſe, then to denie
the Pope and Generall Councells, that, which
they themſelues grant to an artificer, which is
the expoſition of ſacred letters. For the which
with moſt holie prudence it is prohibited, that
the canonicall bookes goe not abroade in vulgar
tongues: &amp; that not abſolutely as the heretiques
doe feine, but when they haue no commentarie;
for with it there is no prohibition at all; Rather
if we conſider that which goeth written in ſuch
a multitude of ſpirituall bookes, with great faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
may (whoſoeuer is wel read in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) they haue
notice, not only of that which is in the ſacred
ſcripture neceſſarie to ſaluation, but of the letter
itſelfe, and of manie difficulties, and curioſities
of the ſame: ſo that, as much as they alledge, are
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:15857:128"/>
falſe deceiptes; for neither is the Mother tongue
depriued of great miſteries, nor thoſe that are
learned, of holie doctrine, but of the danger of
erring, which the Apoſtle Saint Peter teacheth:
&amp; this is greater in ſome matters then in others:
and in few ſo great, as when matters of reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
are treated of through the great experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
which hath beene had of caſes, in which Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
transforminge him ſelfe into an Angell of
light, hath deceiued, not only perſons vaine &amp;
vitious, but manie verie ſpirituall, as the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Saint Vincent Ferer hath aduertiſed vs in
his commentarie of the ſpirituall life. <hi>Cap. 12. &amp;</hi>

to auoide this danger graue bookes are prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and of authors well knowen and eſteemed,
and others haue beene commanded to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected,
as thoſe of fr. Louis of Granada, which
without aggreuance of as manie as in our times
haue written in vulgar tongues, haue as great
place in pietie and doctrine and proprietie of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
as anie whatſoeuer, and yet were prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
which had beene printed vntill the yeare
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:15857:128"/>
1561. For that they conteined certaine thinges
about the grace of God, and the ſignes thereof
being ſhewen in ſome perſons more ſenſiblie:
and being true and taken out of the doctrine of
the Saintes, and relating ſometimes their owne
wordes, it ſeemed inconuenient it ſhould go in
a vulgar tongue: and the author him ſelfe amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
it, and his bookes haue gone and go in all
languages, with much edification and mightie
profit of the Chriſtian people.</p>
                  <p>Secondly is to be conſidered, that ſome hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories
and examples, which againſt this may be
alleaged out of bookes, in which is much perill,
and are not prohibited, do not proue anie thing
againſt what hath beene ſaide. Firſt becauſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
can not be had of all: and then becauſe the
foundation of ſuch prohibitions is only to auoid
danger of erring; this goeth accordinge to the
neceſſitie of the times; after the which prudence
teacheth that things may be permitted, which
in another occaſion haue beene prohibited, for
why the cauſe ceaſſing, which was the danger,
the effect alſo may ceaſſe. <hi>Ca. 6. de conſecra. dist.

the ſame we read in the Sixth Generall Synod
in the canon 28. where the author of the ſumme

perſon of Chriſt our Sauiour ought to be pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,

And the ſame heed was taken in the manner of
ſpeaking; for we read in the 5. Councel of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,
and in the edict of Iuſtinian the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
and in Euagrius, and S. Iohn Damaſcene,
and other graue authors, that it was prohibited
to call the Virgin our B. Ladie Chriſtotocos,
which is to ſay, Mother of Chriſt, becauſe the
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:15857:129"/>
hereeike Neſtorius gaue her that name, denying
that ſhe might bee called Theotocos, that is,
Mother of God: and ſo only ſhe might be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
Mother of Chriſt. But after the diuell had
taken away Neſtorius, and that there is no feare
that a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ie one in Europe will follow him, we
confeſſe Chriſt our Sauiour for true God, &amp; as
properly and commonly we call the moſt holie
Virgin, Mother of Chriſt, as Mother of God. And
of theſe exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples many might be related, of which
the heretikes doe pretend to helpe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, for
to put a vaine change in the decrees &amp; vſe of the
church. But their calumniation doth clearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,
becauſe noueltie ruled by the times neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie,
is not Inſtabilitie, but Prudence: and hence
ſpringeth that it is permitted in one time, what
in another is prohibited, and prohibited at one
time what at another was permitted, to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
whatſoeuer occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of peril, without hauing
for manie of theſe things new decrees, with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
reuocation of the ancient; When the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſal
cuſtome ſufficeth, tolerated by the church,
and head Biſhop. As proueth Paulus Borgatius,
with the authoritie of graue authors, and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
of Hoſtienſis in his Summe, &amp; of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall,

The third thing to be noted is, that there are
manie kinds of Saints, or bleſſed perſons, whom
the Chriſtian people may and ought to worſhip.
The firſt degree, hath thoſe which are declared
for ſuch in whatſoeuer of the canonicall bookes
of the new and old teſtament, whoſe ſanctitie
if it ſhould be denied or put in doubt, it wold
be a formall hereſie, as it is to doubt of the truth
of the holie ſcripture.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond degree, is that of the ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Sain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
whom the tradition of the vniuerſall church
holdeth from their beginnings for ſuch Saintes,
building them temples, altars, and celebrating
their feaſtes, inuocating their interceſſion: and
the ſanctitie of ſuch is authenticke, in ſo much
that the heretiques themſelues confeſſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence
it, although they confeſſe not the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
of the Saints: and to denie the ſanctitio
of ſuch, ſhould be the ſame errour, as to affirme
that the vniuerſall church which the holie ſpirit
doth enlighten, may erre in a matter ſo graue as
this is.</p>
                  <p>The third degree, is of the Saints which we
call canonized, not becauſe thoſe of the ſecond
degree are not ſo, which ar alſo by the vniuerſall
church, as hath beene ſaide, canonized; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
notice beinge had of certeine deceiptes
which ſome particular churches had in admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:15857:130"/>
for Saints thoſe which were none, appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
falſe miracles wherwith the diuell did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
to deceiue the people, the Romane Biſhops
as vniuerſall Paſtors, and the generall Councels,
willing to procure an opportune remedie to this
dammage, reſerued to themſelues this caſe of
of canonizing Saints, which is, to propoſe them
for ſuch to the vniuerſall church, after hauing
ſought out their life and miracles; with ſo much
diligence as we ſee it done, and this began in
the yeare of our Lord eight hundred and three,
when Pope Leo the third canonized, at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the Emperour Carolus Magnus, Saint
Suitbertus Biſhop, although afterward the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation
of this caſe to the Romane church, was
more expreſſed by Alexander the third, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
by the chapter, <hi>audiuimus. (de reliq. &amp; ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neratione
Sanctorum.</hi>) and the ſolemnitie of cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
with which it is now vſed hath beene
continued, and there haue beene canonized ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentie
and three, adding eleuen to the compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
which Freer Angelus de Roca made, in
the booke which he wrote vpon this matter,
where he ſaith, that although being ſacriſtane
of the Pope, he vſed great diligence, yet he hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
for certaine, that ſome haue beene forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by him: and ſo it is that he put not Saint
Elzearius, and ſeauen Martyres of our ſacred re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:15857:131"/>
which ſuffered in Cepta, and with three
which haue beene canonized after he had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
which are Saint Raimundus, S. Franciſca,
and Saint Charles, is made the ſaid number of
eleuen: and of the ſaid ſeauentie and three, four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and three are religious, and of theſe, twentie
and fiue only of our order, counting thoſe of
the third rule.</p>
                  <p>The fourth degree, is of Saints which in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
places are worſhipped, and are called Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified;
for the proceſſe of their life and miracles
hauing bene ſeene by perſons to whom the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicall
ſea committeth this charge, licence hath
beene giuen that they may be worſhipped, and
inuocated with publicke prayers by ſome reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
or people, or kingdome, &amp;c. in the meane
time that the cauſe of the canonization be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.</p>
                  <p>The fifth degree, is of Saints which are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped
by the faithfull in different places with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being canonized, or beatified, in the manner
ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: the which although they dyed after that
the Roman church reſerued to it ſelfe the decree
of the canonization, the cuſtome of celbrating
their feaſt with publicke prayers in all the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall
church, are neuertheles ſo ancient and ſo
notorious, as the ſaid vſe and permiſſion is hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
for a tacite canonization, and ſuch like in all
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:15857:131"/>
and through al, we worſhip as canoniſed Saints;
as for example ſake Saint Roch, is neither cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized,
nor beatified in the forme aboue ſaid, yet
almoſt through all the church generally his feaſt
is celebrated, his name is inuocated, and churches
are dedicated to him &amp;c. with ſo notable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of the ſea Apoſtolicke, as this ſame paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
in Rome it ſelfe. And of theſe many are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped
in diuers kingdomes.</p>
                  <p>The laſt degree, is of thoſe who by the notice
which is had of their holie life and miracles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
and after their death, the faithfull doe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
with particular veneration, and not publick
and ſolemne: and theſe are of more or leſſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,
conforme to the antiquitie, and notice
which is had of their life and miracles, and the
approbation or permiſſion of the ſuperiors. It
remaineth now to ſee the veneration which to
ſuch Saints may and ought to be giuen lawfully.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly it is noted, that in as much as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
the veneration due to the Saints, it is not
heere treated of that which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerned the Saints
of the fiue degrees propoſed, becauſe it is not a
thing in controue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſie among the Catholiques,
and that which againſt the heretiques is defined
by the church, and the Doctors doe write, is not
matter for this purpoſe, but only that which
toucheth thoſe of the laſt degree: in which is
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:15857:132"/>
the bleſſed Ioane. I ſay therefore that the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
of this truth fundamentally preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth
another truth, which is, that there are
two manners of celebration, veneration, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation
of Saints: the one is publicke and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall;
this is made in the name of all the church,
and with the authoritie therof expreſſe or tacite;
and another particular, and this latter is diuided
alſo into particular ſecret, one commending him
ſelfe to the prayers of whom he holdeth for a
Saint: and into particular publicke and noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
as proclaiming one for a Saint, hanging
vp lampes &amp; making otherlike demonſtrations.</p>
                  <p>This ſuppoſed, two thinges are certaine, and
in one is the difficultie which maketh to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
The firſt thing certaine is, that the venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
publicke and generall in the name of all the
church, only can and ought to be done to the
Saints of the firſt fiue degrees, keeping in what
concerneth the beatified in the order of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion:
becauſe in ſome it is more limited then
in others. And the ſecond thing alſo certaine, is,
that the veneration, or inuocation particular &amp;
ſecret, euerie one may make to whomſoeuer he
holdeth for iuſt, aliue or dead, without hauing
more defect herein then in giuing more credit to
the ſanctitie of anie one, then prudence teacheth,
but in fine his intent is good, as only to eſteeme
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:15857:132"/>
and honour virtue, a thing which the very light
of nature teacheth, as Ariſtotle (1. <hi>Ethic. cap.</hi> 5.)
affirmeth. And that this honour is due, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
to the liuing, but alſo to the dead, the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers
came to know, as Plato, and others,
with Euſebius noteth it. (<hi>lib. 13. de praeparat. euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel.
c. 6. &amp;</hi> 7.) yet the Saints haue proceeded fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
prouing that the honour and veneration
done to the good, liuinge and dead, is done to
God him ſelfe in his Saints: and ſo ſaith Saint
Baſil. (<hi>D. Baſil. in orat. in 40. Martyr. lib. 4. cap.
16.) Honor quem bonis conſeruis exhibemus beneuoli,
erga communem Dominum ſignificationem de ſe prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet.</hi>
The ſame Saint Iohn Damaſcene proueth
almoſt in the ſame wordes: and Saint Hierome
in his epiſtle to Ripario, doth ſay: <hi>honoremus ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uos,
vt eorum honor redundat ad Dominum. (ſerm. 6.
in fine.</hi>) And in the life of Saint Paule, he celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
much the deuotion wherwith ſhee caſt her
ſelfe at the ſeere of the eremites, not thinking
her ſelfe worthie to kiſſe them, and the Saint
ſaith, ſo much ſhe worſhipped, as if in euery one
of them ſhe worſhipped Ieſus Chriſt. (<hi>Lib. de
Virginitate.) Ac ſi in ſingulis Dominum adoraret.</hi>
And it is no merueile for why, S. Athanaſius in
his booke of virginitie, ſaith: <hi>St homo iustus do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mumtuam
intrauerit, adorabis humi ad pedes illius:
Deum enim qui illum mittit adorabis.</hi> So as if one
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:15857:133"/>
reuerence him whom he holdeth for a Saint,
dead or aliue, he doth not ſinne, although the
ſame were no Saint, for his intention is not but
to reuerence true ſanctitie: as if one adored a
hoſte vnconſecrated, thinkinge it to be conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated;
it is cleere that he meriteth (as Doctors
doe note) by the ſame reaſon. <hi>Medina 3 p. q. 25.
a. con.</hi> 4.</p>
                  <p>In like manner as theſe two things of publicke
veneration in the name of all the church, and of
the particular of euerie one, are certaine, ſo that
which ſuppoſeth the doubt, and maketh to our
purpoſe is, in the particular publicke, which is
called particular, becauſe it is not generall, nor is
made in name of the church: and it is called pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blicke,
becauſe the actions of veneration are ſo,
as is declared.</p>
                  <p>Concerning this manner of veneration, two
extreames muſt be fledd, and the middle may be
followed. The one extreme is, that of thoſe who
with apparence of pietie, approue falſe miracles,
and other actions, by which the people proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
one for a Saint, with great perill of appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
feigned ſanctitie, whereupon haue beene
ſeene pittifull caſes, of which the hiſtories are
full, procured by the diuell; not ſo much for to
deceiue in that article, as to diſcredit true virtue:
and ſo all that which in this matter ſhall not be
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:15857:133"/>
cenſured and iudged by the ſuperiours to whom
it belongeth, is holden ſuſpected. And in theſe
caſes, as the iudgements and opinions of men are
diuers, ſo alſo are their effectes and feelings; for
ſome w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>epe, and others laugh, and others are
diſmay<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d, and of all the diuell draweth much
gaine. The other extreme, is of them who ſo
much ſtreighten this matter, as they affirme to
be prohibited what ſome euer kind of exteriour
veneration, as to hang vp lampes, to offer guifts,
to call one a Saint, although it be in particular,
without ſpeciall approbation and decree of the
ſea apoſtolique. So thought Francis de Pegna, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor
of the Rota in a treatie which he compoſed
of this matter. (<hi>cap. ſi quis hominem. 11. q.</hi> 3.) where
he affirmeth that ſo it was decreed by the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<hi>ſi quis homin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>m,</hi> and by the firſt and ſecond
chapter, <hi>de reliquijs &amp; veneratione Sanctorum:</hi> and
is the ſentence of Hoſtienſis, whom commonly
the canoniſtes doe follow vpon theſe textes, and
that it is proued in proper tearmes by Zanguinus
in the treatie de Haereticis cap 12. num. 8. and
the author of the Repertorie of the inquiſitors,
<hi>verbo canonizatus.</hi> §. <hi>&amp; ſi tales,</hi> and from hence
he inferreth that which without doubt he tooke
for aſſumpt in that treatie, which was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne

that the ſaid texts prohibit the publicke and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
veneration in name of the whole church,
but not the particular, although there come
with them publicke actions and notorious, as
hath beene ſaide, in conſequence wherof muſt
be approued or reproued ſuch like actions, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordinge
to the ground which there is for the

ſhall be worthie of reprehenſion, as light and

and laudable: and ſo is the veneration particular
and publicke, which in ſo manie places is made
to manie Saints, which although they are not
canonized nor beatified, their ſanctitie is know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
by the notoriouſneſſe of their holie life, and
the manifeſtation of their miracles, and by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

like, although we call them Saints, as we would
ſay the holie Freer Didacus, the holie freer Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundus
&amp;c. we doe not yet giue them the title
of Saint abſolutely, as to ſay Saint Raymundus,
Saint Didacus, vntill they be canonized; For to
graduate them with this title, the church reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
for the action of the canonization, as is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:15857:135"/>
of the firſt booke of the ſacred ceremonies,
(<hi>ſect. 6. cap.</hi> 2. §. <hi>antequam.</hi>) where treating of
the proceſſe of the canonization, this title of

in the which are put theſe wordes: <hi>Decernimus

And that which to the contrarie Francis Pegna
would perſwade, beſides that it is contrarie to
what himſelfe required to ſee himſelfe in Rome
with the bleſſed Franciſca, and manie other bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
bodies, which neither are canonized, nor
beatified, it is ſcrupulous without apparance of
ground. Firſt becauſe the moſt ancient cuſtome
hath ſo receiued it, as we ſee in ſuch a number of
graue authors ancient and moderne, which to
ſuch like doe giue the name of Saints, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
the veneration which in diuerſe partes, is
made them: of this are the bookes full, not only
of thoſe who haue written the liues of Saints,
as Surius, Lipomanus, Vincentius Bellouacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,
and others, and the chronicles of Religions
with infinite graue authors: but euen in the very
bookes of the holy Fathers, and which is more,
in the Generall Councells is found this manner
of ſpeach. Nor is it againſt this to ſay, that thoſe
authors were before the ſaide decrees; for ſome
of them were after, as S. Bernard, S. Raymun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,
S. Bonauenture, S. Antoninus of Florence,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:15857:135"/>
and many others, whoſe language to condemne
wold be temeritie. Secondly, becauſe not only
bookes of hiſtory, but the Romane Martyrologe
it ſelfe, which euery day is read in the diuine
office at Prime, calleth Saints many centenaries
yea thouſands of perſons, which neither are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonized
nor beatified. Thirdly that which cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
conuinceth (as well noteth Azorius <hi>Tom. 2.
p. 2. lib.</hi> 5.) among thoſe things which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by the Pope of Rome, to be auouched
for the canonizatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a Saint, is the fame which
hath beene of his ſanctitie, and the veneration
which the people doe him: and ſo in all the Buls
which to this ende are diſpatched, is put a clauſe
with this demand following. <hi>An magno pietatis
affectu &amp; ſtudio eum fuerit populus proſecutus? an
apud populum haeatur pro beato, qui in coeleſti pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tria
vita perfrui aeterna credatur, quam frequenter
eius ſepulchrum viſitare ſolet, eius opem &amp; pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trecinium
apud Deum implorando, &amp; multa offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendo,
&amp; tabellas gratiarum ab eo obtentarum
indies appendendo.</hi> Theſe thinges then be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and holy, when the Popes doe command
to auouch them for an argument of the defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which they pretend to make in ſo graue a
matter.</p>
                  <p>This ſuppoſed, it remaineth to ſatisfie in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
the cenſurers of this booke, who (as
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:15857:136"/>
hath beene ſaide) are ſome learned and prudent,
and others ſcrupulous and ignorant: the firſt
thincke it conuenient to take away ſome reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
and other caſes, which not being for all,
it is not good that they go in vulgar tongues, for
the reaſons ſpoken of in the firſt and ſecond pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſition,
and ſo it hath beene done: &amp; not
only in the places which they pointed out, but
alſo in many others, without making thereby
any want in the hiſtorie, it beinge no wrong
to retaine in ſilence ſome truthes; neither yet is
anie iniury done to the originals ſo worthy of
credit, for they are kept with all their authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
vntill it ſhall be neceſſarie to recur to them.</p>
                  <p>There haue beene alſo ſome thinges cut off,
and others declared touching Purgatorie, and
other matters, which although they be true in
rigour of Theologie, yet are not ſo manifeſt to
thoſe who haue not ſtudied; to whom it might
ſerue for a rock of ſcandal, what wel vnderſtood
were matter of edification.</p>
                  <p>Likewiſe in what concerneth the virtue of the
beades, which Chriſt our Lord bleſſed at the
inſtance of this ſeruant of God, hath bene taken
away all whatſomeuer ſounded of iuriſdiction,
as are indulgences; not becauſe we doe not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
but that there are many gained, as tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
hath receiued, but for the reaſon which in
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:15857:136"/>
the 10. chapter is declared, which is, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
of them is not conſtant with that diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
which is conuenient for the publication of
indulgences, and the miracles which hitherto
haue beene au<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uched, although they proue alike
other great virtues, yet not that there are indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences
gained: and ſo this is lefte without wrong
to the truth for if the indulgences bee granted,
they may be gained, and if they be not, the other
virtues are ſuch and ſo maruailous, as they are
ſufficient, that the Chriſtian people may make
ſuch eſtimation of theſe beades, as alwaies they
haue done, and with ſo great reaſon as by and
by we will proue. Alſo the title of Saint, hath
beene taken away, which might haue bene vſed
with the modification expreſſed in the fourth
ſuppoſition; that is to ſay, the Saint Ioane, and
not S. Ioane abſolutely, as before it was; (<hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta

ſatisfaction of thoſe who in this matter do ſpeak
with too much rigour, without condemning for
al this the common language of the people, who
call this ſeruant of God the Saint Ioane, nor that
of ſo many graue authors which giue her this ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle:

                  <p>The ſecond ſorte of cenſurers are the ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
although well meaning; and the firſt thing
wherat they ſtumble is, in that there are related
in this booke, a great multitude of miracles,
without being approued by the ordinarie, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
to the decree of the holy cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel of Trent,
and the truth is, that this decire for prouing mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
and reliques, is not new, but a confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of many others moſt ancient, by the which
if theſe ſcrupulous would paſſe their eyes with
a very litle obſeruance that they might make for
the vnderſtanding of them, they ſhold be verie
farr from giuing ſuch cenſure: For there is verie
great difference betweene approning miracles &amp;
reliques, and relating them in a hiſtorie, the firſt
is reſerued to Superiours, accordinge to the
qualitie of the ende for which the approbation
is intended: and the ſecond is graunted to all as
many as haue beene borne in the world; ſeing
that ſince the beginning thereof, haue beene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
and written diuers miraculous caſes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
that any one haue more obligation for the

had. And Ariſtotle ſaith. (1. <hi>Ethic. lib. 3. cap.</hi> 7.)
from whom Cicero tooke it, that all thinges
muſt not be handled with ſuch ſubtilitie, that a
mathematicall demonſtration be made of them,
but that the arguments wherwith that ſhall be
proued which is related, muſt be according to
the ſubiect wherof is treated, and the end wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is treated. In ſuch manner as to relate by
worde or writing, a miracle which God did by
the interceſſion of any Saints, it is not more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie,
then to haue he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rd it, of perſons wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of credit. But to publiſh with ſolemnitie
this miracle, and to celebrate it with feſtiuitie
in thankeſgiuing, or to take it for argument of
the ſanctitie of that Saint, for to canonize him
or beatifie him &amp;c. the approbation of a ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
is neceſſarie, to whom according to the law
it belongeth, according to the end for the which
it is pretended to be approued: ſo alſo to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
and hold in reuerence a relique which is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to any one, and to beleeue with pietie that
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:15857:138"/>
it is true, ſufficeth the authority of a perſon wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of credit, who affirmeth that he found it in
ſuch a place or church, worſhipped and had for
ſuch. But if a church or monaſterie which ſhold
much eſteeme a relique, had in this manner, as
we might ſay a head of the eleuen thouſand Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins,
wold recite of them on their day with a
double office, and not of the Saint which the
Kalendar doth aſſigne, as is granted in the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briques
of the breuiarie, it wold be neceſſarie
to haue approbation of that relique, becauſe one
thing it is, to worſhip and eſteeme it in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
and another to approue it for publique mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie,
whereof the ſaid decree of the ſacred cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
teacheth, and the reſt touching this matter.</p>
                  <p>In conſequence wherof to the obiection it is
answered. Firſt, that the miracles which are
written in bookes, which are infinite, as in the
cronicles of religions, and other innumerable
tracts; not for this are approued and publiſhed
authorizedly, which is that which the law pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibteth,
commanding that it be done with au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the ordinary: &amp; that which this booke
conteineth is the ſame, with infinite others an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
and moderne, where is recounted that
which in euery parte happened, and euery one
may giue it the credit that he will.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that which is written of this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:15857:138"/>
of God, is the ſame which of her haue
written ſo graue authors, as haue bene related:
and if in their hiſtories this inconuenience was
not found, there is no cauſe wherefore it ſhould
be found in this booke.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly and principally, with which it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
there remayneth no kinde of doubt in this
matter, is, that being ſo many bookes which
ſpeake of miracles, in few, or it may be in none
ſhall be found the warineſſe that is in this, for
ſpeaking in the context of the hiſtorie of ſome
miraculous thing, euery one is related as it was
found, and as it is, for it is ſaide ſuch a miracle
ſuch a one recounted, and ſuch a one paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſuch and ſuch perſons, and of ſuch a miracle
was information made by commiſſion of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,
and is in the archiue of the councell of
the moſt illuſtrious of Toledo, and of ſuch an
one made information only the Iuſtice of the
people, and of ſuch an one, the Father Generall
of the order with ſuch witneſſes, and of ſuch an
one is knowen no more then what the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
ſayeth, or is found by tradition. And this
beinge ſo cleare, what hath the approbation
(which the holy councell of Trent commandeth
to be made for the publiſhing of a new miracle)
to doe with this hiſtory, written in imitation of
as many authors as haue written liues of Saints,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:15857:139"/>
from the time that the church was founded, and
from the ſame councell vnto this day, and with
more warineſſe then the reſt, when they only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
the caſe, and the author of this cronicle ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
that which hath beene ſaide?</p>
                  <p>The ſecond obiection which they oppoſe is,
the greatneſſe of the fauours which our Lord is
ſhewen to haue done to this ſeruant of God; the
which are ſuch and ſo great, as with great reaſon
may cauſe not only much admiration, but ſome
doubte in beleeuing them. And I anſwere, that
the admiration in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration of the workes
of God, is for to acknowledge the greatneſſe of
his clemency and liberality, and for it to giue
him thankes, <hi>conſideraui opera tua, &amp;c.</hi> ſaid the
Prophet: of this admiration God draweth light
to all the virtues, for, <hi>mirabilia opera tua, &amp; ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma
mea cognoſcet nimis.</hi> For faith is confirmed,
and charitie is enkindled more for to loue ſuch
a Lord and ſo liberall, and hope is many waies
nouriſhed, by hoping that God will worke in
vs what he hath wrought in our neighbour. But
to draw out of the greatneſſe of the fauours of
God, coldneſſe to beleeue them leſſe, is to thinke
baſely of the infinite liberality of God, and to
meaſure the ſame by the ſhortneſſe of our mind,
without conſideration that it is conſequent to
the liberality of God to be infinite in giuing the
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:15857:139"/>
moſt with beſt will: and ſo the deſire and hope
in the thinges of the worlde, are different from
thoſe of thinges diuine: for in humane thinges,
while that is greater which is deſired, the hope
of obteininge it is leſſe, and in diuine thinges,
contrariewiſe.</p>
                  <p>For being we treat with one that is infinitely
moſt magnificent, while the pretenſion more
encreaſeth, the hope will be more firme: and
this the Apoſtle S. Paule calleth to abound more
in hope and virtue of the holy Spirit. <hi>Deus autem
ſpei repleat vos omni gaudio &amp; pace in credendo, vt
abundetis magis in ſpe &amp; virtute Spiritus ſancti.
(Rom.</hi> 15.) and ſo the Prophet Heliſaeus. (4. <hi>Reg.</hi>
4.) willing to enrich a poore widdow with gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
her ſuch abunda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of miraculous oyle, that
ſhe might pay her debters and liue of the reſt,
fearing in her ſome ſcantneſſe of minde (as there
is in theſe ſcrupulous perſons) aduertiſed her to
aske veſſels, not of one of her neighbours but of
all, nor a few veſſels, but manie. <hi>Vade pete mutuo
ab omnibus vicinis tuis vaſa vacua non pauca.</hi> And
although ſhe did ſo, and they were all filled, the
Prophet demanded if ſhe had more veſſels: and
anſwering, no; the oyle ceaſſed; in ſuch ſorte that
it failed not for fault of the giuer, but for want
of veſſels to receiue it in.</p>
                  <p>And in like compete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce alwaies wil God ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come;
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:15857:140"/>
in ſuch ſorte as the fauours done to the
B. Saint Ioane are not leſſe credible becauſe they
are great how much more if we read the bookes a
of the Saints, which are full of meruailous ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
where is ſhewen how our Lord hath done
very great mercies to theeues, robbers, and to
all ſor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

they leſt deſerued it, for his ſecret iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and declaration of his infinite mercie:
then what great thing is it, that he hath done
the ſame for a choſen ſeruant from her mothers
wombe. And finally theſe are not amazed at the
greatneſſe, for they know it not, nor can tell in
what it conſiſteth, but at the noueltie and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
caſes: and in humane thinges this hath
ſome ground, but in the diuine, it is the parte of
blockheads not to conſider vpon the great thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
which God doth ordinarilie, and to admire
much at the extraordinarie, as S. Auguſtine pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth,
ſaving of ſuch, <hi>vt non maiora, ſed in ſolit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the accoumpt, if they ſhall make the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that heere ſhalbe repreſented vnto them,
and this it is that they let looſe the reynes of
their vnderſtandinge, and add to the fauours
which in this booke are related, that our Lord
did to this his ſeruant, other greater, more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,

and admirable; in ſuch ſorte as if it be rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

let theſe viſites be in publicke, and with
all the celeſtiall courte, and many times eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye

admiration it hath cauſed them? what thankes
they haue giuen to our Lord? with what ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
they haue acknowledged a fauour ſo vnequal
to as many as haue beene related of S. Ioane, &amp;
might be related of S. Iohn Baptiſt, and of all
the Saints? of whom we take no aduantage for
her, as theſe ignorantly doe ſay, by the greatneſſe
of the fauors, for why the degrees of grace and
glorie, which the diuines doe call eſſentiall, are
not meaſured with theſe exteriour demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
And ſo Caietane ſaith very well, that if by

the multitude of miracles, we muſt make com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of the greatneſſe of the ſanctitie, much
aduantage wold Saint Antonie of Padua haue
of Saint Peter, and great temerity it ſhold be, to
compare the one with the other, how much
more to aduance Saint Antony, as Saint Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas

                  <p>Secondly to ſome hath beene a great nouel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
the tearme of conſecratinge of bleſſinge the
Image of our Ladie, and to others, that Chriſt
our Lord himſelfe hath done this miniſterie, at
the ſupplicatien of this his eſpouſe: and although
in al of them ignorance haue place, yet it is more
groſſe in the former; becauſe the eccleſiaſticall
ceremonie of bleſſing Croſſes, Images altars &amp;c.
is an apoſtolicall tradition, of which are full not
only the ſacred councels and apoſtolical decrees,
but the manualls moſt ordinarie, and in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Pontificall. (<hi>Pontif. Rom. 2. p. fol.</hi> 505.) there
is an eſpeciall rubrique with this title. <hi>De bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictione
Imaginis Virginis Mariae.</hi> Neither yet is it
a new thing for Ieſus Chriſt to doe ſuch like fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours,
when we read in ſo many graue authors,
(<hi>Vincent. Valda. in ſpeculo hiſtoriar. lib. 23. c. 36. &amp;</hi>
37.) that in the yeare 644. our Lord Ieſus Chriſt
in his proper perſon, bleſſed and conſecrated the
temple of S. Denis, neer Paris: and ſo alſo he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:15857:141"/>
the church of the monaſterie of Senon
in France: at the miraculous conſecration wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
were heard the voices of Angels, which did
ſing, and there appeared in the corners of the
temple Croſſes, which are wont to be put in
churches which are conſecrated. The ſame is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
of the glorious Apoſtle Saint Peter, that
miraculouſly he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecrated a church of his name
of Weſtminſter in London in the yeare 610. and
anointed it with holy oyle: and after it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated,
were ſeene in the walls of the temple,
the Croſſes which the Apoſtle had put, and the
candles of wax which had burned in the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration:
And Saint Mellitus Biſhop of that cittie
being informed of this truth, doubted in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
if he ſhold againe conſecrate that temple,
or no: and deferred the reſolution vntill being
in Rome in a councell, he conſulted this matter
with Pope Boniface the 4. and it was determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
that it ought not be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecrated againe, ſith
it had beene done by the Apoſtle S. Peter. This
doerelate S. Bede, Surius, Caeſar Baronius, and
is found in the ſecond tome of the ſaide coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells
which anew hath beene printed in the life
of S. Boniface the 8. fol. 963. <hi>Beda. lib. 2. hiſt. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliae

                  <p>Thirdly it troubled many, to read that one
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:15857:142"/>
Chapter of this booke, which hath for title, how
the holy Ghoſt ſpake thirteene yeares by the
mouth of Saint Ioane, and that this manner of
ſpeakinge is many times repeated, which ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
reſerued to the authors, only of the ſacred
ſcripture; when euen of the authors of the Popes
definitions, and of the Generall Councells, we
doe not ſay that they had immediate reuelation
of the holy Ghoſt, but aſſiſtance that they could
not erre. This ſuperficially ſpoken, ſeemeth to
haue ſome appearance of reaſon, but the truth
cleared, no obiection hath beene put againſt this
booke with leſſe ground; for the differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce which
is betweene an immediate reuelation from God
to the authors of the ſacred bookes, and the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
of the church not to erre, is a matter ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
ſcholaſticall, and which is not touched in
this booke, nor is any thing to the purpoſe of
that which therin is treated of many, as the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
doe teach.</p>
                  <p>For to declare this difference, and the langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
in ſaying, the holy Ghoſt ſpake by the mouth
of ſuch a partie, is common to all kinde of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
not only Saints, but without difference
betweene good and euill: ſeing Saint Iohn ſaith,
that the holy Ghoſt ſpake by the mouth of Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas,
and Saint Auguſtin and Saint Hierom, by
the mouthes of the Sibills which were genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les.
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:15857:142"/>
Finally the Prophets haue ſaide that God
ſpake in them. <hi>Haec dicit Dominut.</hi> And S. Paule:
<hi>Ego enim accepi à Domino:</hi> And Saint Auguſtine
in diuerse places, and particularly in the pream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the 118. Pſalme. And our holy Father S.
Francis ſaith in his teſtament: <hi>Nemo oſtendebat
mihi, quid deberem ſacere, ſed ipſe altiſs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>mus reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lauit
mihi. (In testamento S. Franciſci.</hi>) And the
ſame may whatſoeuer perſon ſay. And betweene
the truth which God manifeſteth by the mouth
of Iſaias, or by the mouth of Saint Francis, or
of whatſomeuer perſons, there is no difference
in the reaſon of truth, for as infallible is the one
as the other, God being the author, who nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can, becauſe he is infinitely wife, be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
nor ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, becauſe he is infinitly good, deceiue:
but the difference conſiſteth in knowing, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing,
that God hath reuealed this truth, for
that which Iſaias ſaith is not only of faith becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe
God hath ſaide it; but alſo it is of faith that
God hath ſaid it, for ſo the holy church hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
it, but in other truthes, we hold them for
ſuch, becauſe we beleeue that God hath ſaid the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
becauſe Saint Auguſtine or Saint Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cis &amp;c. hath
ſaide it. And to euery thing of humane faith, is
giuen the credit which the author deſerueth: to
Saint Auguſtin and Saint Francis, as to ſo great
Saints: and to whomſoeuer els, to ſuch an one
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:15857:143"/>
as he is. And this being ſo plaine, there is no
improprietie in the ſaide manner of ſpeakinge,
but rather much conuenience; becauſe not only
the hiſtory propoſeth that the holy Ghoſt ſpake
by the mouth of this his ſeruant, the things ſhee
ſpake being ſo holy, but alſo for the manner ſo
merueilous of preaching being eleuated and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorpte:
And if the admiration grewe out of this
noueltie, it is not a caſe which hath not happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to others, when the ſame hath ſucceded of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
to S. Catharine of Siena, of whom moſt
graue hiſtories doe recount, that being in exta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies
from her ſences, ſhe made long ſpeaches and
moſt deuoute orations, which the holy Ghoſt
did inſpire into her. <hi>S. Antonin. 3. p. hist. tit. 25. cap.</hi>
14. §. 17. <hi>Chronica de S. Dominic. 2. p. lib. 2. cap.</hi> 44.</p>
                  <p>And that God ſo communicateth himſelfe in
this ſorte to this ſeruants being in extaſies, and
out of their ſenſes, and to doe them ſo great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours,
is, becauſe the greatneſſe of the thinges
which he communicateth them is ſo ſuperiour
to the forces of nature, and the capacitie of man
ſo ſhort and limited, that for thoſe that it can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
it is neceſſary to eſtrange it from the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
ſenſes, as was ſeene in Adam, of whom
S. Bernard ſaith, that when God wold eleuate
him to thinges purely ſpirituall and diuine, he
caſt him in a kind of ſleepe, his ſoule being ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uated
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:15857:143"/>
in ſublime operation, aboue all materiall
and ſenſible things: and that not as ſomethinke,
becauſe he ſhold not feele the paine of his ribbe
which was taken out, for to that without a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
miracle no ſleepe could ſuffice: and ſo
the ſleepe of Adam, according as is gathered of
the holy ſcripture, and of diuerſe tranſlations,
was not ſleepe purely naturall, but extaticall
and miraculous, as are thoſe which in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templatiue
are called extaſies and raptes, becauſe
the ſenſes ceaſſing &amp; the imagination from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
things, Adam might receiue more purely
the ſpirituall and diuine, which our Lord did
communicate vnto him; the ſtile moſt ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
with which his maieſtie doth communicate

estaſin, and the Hebrew tardemach, which is profound
ſleepe. Aquila and Symachus tranſlated it, grauem
&amp; profundum ſoperem, which is the ſame.</hi>)</p>
                  <p>And in this ſorte he is found to haue commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
himſelfe to this his moſt deuote ſeruant,
for as his delightes are alwayes to be with the
children of men. (<hi>Prouerb.</hi> 8.) ſo the familiaritie
hath beene very great with which in all times
he hath handled them. How can I doe a thinge
that Abraham may not know? ſaide our Lord
when he would deſtroy Sodome. (<hi>Genesis</hi> 18.)
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:15857:144"/>
And with Moyſes the holy ſcripture ſaith that
that he ſpake as one freind with another. (<hi>Exod.</hi>
33.) Of this kinde are the prophecies, viſions &amp;
reuelations of all the Prophets of the old teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the raptes of the Apoſtles, as is that
which S. Luc. recounteth of the Apoſtle S. Paule
in the actes of the Apoſtles cap. 9. euen to the
third heauen, in which he knew ſuch things, as
after he could not tell how to ſpeake. The rapte
of the ſheet of S. Peter, Actorum. 10. where he
knew the conuerſion of the gentiles; and all the
prophecies and reuelations which the Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
church hath had ſince the Apoſtles, which
are almoſt infinite, of which the chronicles and
liues of the Saints are full: of the ſame priuiledge
and fauour women haue enioyed, before and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the coming of Chriſt, for God hath not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
them from this fauour &amp; theſe mercies:
And God who ſaith by Oſeas. cap. 2. I wil leade
her into ſolitude, and ſpeake to her in the harte;
doth not only ſpeake with men, nor is his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull
hand abbreuiated with women more then
with them; for we know that the ſpirite of our
Lord breatheth where it will, and that God is
no accepter of perſons (Ioannis cap. 3.) to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
women from ſo great a good.</p>
                  <p>Rather in all times and ages there haue beene
many in the world with whom he hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated

himſelfe largely and moſt liberally. (<hi>S.

Toledo, Cardinall, inquiſitor generall of Spaine,
was tranſlated into Spaniſh, there goe imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
ſome of the orations &amp; exhortations, which
this holy Virgin made, being in extaſies, and
abſtract from her ſences, and one with this
title. The fifth oration, which the holie Virgin
made in Rome, on Friday the 18. of Februarie in
the yeare 1573. being in abſtraction after hauing
communicated. Another ſaith, the eleuenth ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
which the ſame holy Virgin made in Rome,
on the day of the annunciation of the moſt B.
Virgin Marie our Ladie: the which ſhe made in
abſtraction. Another ſaith thus: the 22. prayer,
made in rapte of eleuation of the holy ſpirit, on
the day of the conuerſion of S. Paule: and they
are full of moſt high miſteries, and of many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the ſacred ſcripture, which the Saint moſt
highly declared being eleuated.</p>
                  <p>Neither is it againſt this to ſay, that theſe are
Saints canonized, for ſome of them be not ſo,
and none of them were when theſe merueills
were written of them: for S. Antoninus and
Saint Raimu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ous who wrote the things of Saint
Catharine of Siena, died hundreds of yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſhe was canonized: and the ſame is alſo of
almoſt all the reſt, rather theſe ſame thinges
which were written of theſe Saints and went
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:15857:146"/>
about the world with ſo much edification of the
Chriſtian people, were the moſt efficacious mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
to deale about their canonization, and to
effect it: and the ſame I hope in our Lord ſhall
ſucced to our bleſſed Ioane. And neuertheleſſe
the title of the ſaide chapter hath beene changed
from whence it was before, how the holy Ghoſt
ſpake thirteene yeares by the mouth of S. Ioane;
now it is, how by the diuine virtue the ſeruant
of God ſpake for the ſpace of thirteene yeares;
and that which was taken away, is the ſame
which was put, in realtie of truth, but hath an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
appara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of thoſe which haue not ſtudied.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, it ſeemed alſo to thoſe a thing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
to haue beene kept in ſilence, the miracle of
the Angel hauing caried to heauen the roſaries,
and to bring them downe againe bleſſed by our
Lord, being a thing vnheard of, and ſo extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie,
but it is a correction without ground.
Firſt, becauſe that which is related of the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
was manifeſt by the teſtimonie of a whole
conuent, and the tradition of the ſame hath bene
ſo continued for the ſpace of ſo many yeares, and
confirmed with the ſanctitie of the ſeruant of
God, and with ſo many and ſo famouſe miracles:
and againe, becauſe it is not a caſe without an
example, but there are many in thinges which
ſhall bee ſeene, for they deſcended from heauen,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:15857:146"/>
or howſoeuer it be, wee enioy them by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie
of Angels; And ſetting aſide ſome of that
which the ſcripture treateth, as the Manna, the
ſword or holy Knife which Hieremias brought
to Iudas Machabeus. (2. <hi>Mach.</hi> 15.) there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
others which the Chriſtian people venerate,
as the Croſſe of the Angels, which is kept in the
holie church of Ouiedo, and that of Crauaca, the

                  <p>Many other things of leſſe ſubſtance did theſe
ſcrupulous perſons note with impertinent pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations,
to which I doe not anſwere, for with
the grounds alreadie layed as before, they are
ſatisfied. One ſaid to my ſelfe, how can it be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to be ſaid that two daies before the paſſage
of this ſeruant of God, ſhee had begonne to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy
the alacritie of glorie; when euen of the
Virgin our bleſſed Ladie no ſuch thing is ſaide?
and I answered him ſhewinge him the Roman
breuiarie, where of S. Marie Magdalen, and of
others, are ſuch like thinges recounted: and in
particular it is related of Saint Nicolas Tole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tine,
that the ſame paſſed with him for ſix whole Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:15857:148"/>
before he died. So that they ſpeake by
geſſe. <hi>Breu. Rom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But becauſe in matter of this obiection of the
beades of bleſſed S. Ioane, and thoſe which were
touched at them, ſome thinges haue beene ſaide
and done, which might haue bene excuſed if the
exceſſes of ſome ſuperſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s did not oblige vnto
it, as I beleeue, ſo I ſay, that ſetting this aſide,
moſt pious is the deuotion which with theſe
things the Chriſtian people doth ſhew, &amp; moſt
oppoſite to the obloquies wherwith the hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques
do procure to condemne it. Theodore Beza
a Caluiniſt heretique, wrote a treatie which he
intituled of the trifles of Saint Francis. (<hi>Beza de
nenijs S. Franciſci.</hi>) and William Ritbelt, another
of the childiſh worſhip of the papiſts: and both
of them mock much at the deuote pietie, with
which the faithfull doe venerate bleſſed things,
as the water, the boughes, the candles, &amp;c. and
the ſaid William doth recount ſome things with
which it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eemeth to him he confirmeth his diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates.
He ſaith that being in Rome he ſaw with
his eyes, that going the ſtations, the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
touched a roſarie which he caried in his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
at a glaſſe window, which ſtood before a relique:
And he ſaw that on the firſt day of lent, the Pope
and Cardinals being in Saint Sabina, which is a
monaſterie of the order of preachers, the freers
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:15857:148"/>
gaue to the Pope and Cardinals, and to many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
for reliques, or as a pretious gift the leaues
of an oringe tree, which our holy Father S. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicke
had planted: and vpon theſe things, and
others like, they did deſcant mocking at the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of that glaſſe, and of thoſe leaues, and of the
habit of a religious which ſome doe worſhipp,
and of the bleſſed beades and others which are
touched at them &amp;c. that the eſteeme may be
ſeene which of ſuch like trifles, graue men doe
make imitators of ignorant old wiues, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
roſaries of Aue-marias to S. Peter and to S.
Paule. With theſe fooliſh aggrauations, theſe
miſerable men do prouoke the rude people, and
diſpoſe them to perſwade them errors of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
heretiques, which now many yeares had
lien buried in hell; one of the which is, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
the ceremonies and ancient rites of the
church, among which there is more or leſſe, but
in none deformity, or if you pleaſe inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                  <p>For euen as in the reuerence which one doth
to his parents, or ſuperiors, there is more and
leſſe, and if he ſhould faile in the more he ſhold
breake the precept naturall and diuine: and if in
the leſſe, as if he ſhold not put of his hat hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the name of his Father in abſence, or if his
Superior, or benefactor, yet for all this theſe actes
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:15857:149"/>
be not condemned before vſed and laudable, and
actes in effect of curteſie and gratitude. In like
manner there is great difference betweene ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and reuerencing our Lord God, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping
the leafe of the tree which the glorious
Saint Dominicke planted, but all is good and
ſpringeth of one ground. We adore God as Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
and Lord, and we worſhipp his Saints for
ſeruants of his, and that more or leſſe remotely,
conforme to the ſubiect of the action, yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
with one intent: in ſuch ſorte as if we
ſhould aske one of theſe heretiques, if it ſhould
be a ridiculous action, or reprehenſible, that
one wold take off his hatt, hearing the name of
the founder of a colledge where he was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
fuſteined, it beinge a hundred yeares ſince
he died, and is not knowen if he be in heauen
or in hell: and neither he nor any thinge of his
doth ſee that curteſie? he will answere (if he be
not madd) that it is not an inutill acte nor repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible,
but of good curteſie and gratitude.</p>
                  <p>Then why ſhold it be ridiculous to reuerence
neere hand or remotely, a Saint which is enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of God &amp; ſeeth in him the veneration which
to him is done, although it be ſo little as to kiſſe
the glaſſe which is before his relique, or the habit
which he ware, or the religion which he foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
or the tree which he planted, and the earth
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:15857:149"/>
which he troade vpon? and the ſame will alſo
ſay that it is not improprietie one to do ſeruice
to his Lord, or friend in the perſon of another,
as if he did <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ernice to the King to pleaſe ſome
Lord which had commanded it him, or that he
knoweth it will pleaſe him, although he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
it not. Then if this be ſo plaine, what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing is it to recite ſo many Paternoſters,
or Auemarias, or to celebrate a Maſſe in honour
of S. Peter, but to do a ſeruice to our Lord God,
or to his moſt holy Mother in obſequie of S.
Peter, who will ſo much be pleaſed that his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotarie
doe ſerue God and his Mother? So that
the ſayings of theſe ſeducers are vaine aggraua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
And the truth being made cleare, they
haue neither ſubſtance nor apparance of ground,
as is manifeſt. More I could ſay vpon this, but
I leaue to enlarge me, and to applie that hath
beene ſaid not to hitt vpon a knowen action in
this matter; euery one ſhall take what toucheth
him, it ſufficeth to ſay, that the veneration to
theſe beades and to thoſe touched at them is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
holy, and the comparation of their virtues ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
ſufficient, and the doubt whether they be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
or not, of no ſubſtance, when with the
ſame good faith we worſhip reliques and other
pious thinges; in which the Chriſtian people
hath more neede of ſpurres, then of a bridle,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:15857:150"/>
when it is not founded vpon fandy things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ground, or with ſuſpicion of fiction.</p>
                  <p>But the thinges of this ſeruant of God, are
founded vpon a moſt pure life, moſt approued,
and clarified, and vpon a glorious death, &amp; vpon
infinite miracles, and vpon veneration of the
faithfull ſo knowen, and vpon the vncorruptibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
of her holie bodie ſo euident: and vpon tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of all this of ſo many yeares, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
and approued. So neither the greatneſſe
of the fauours which God hath done her, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
them leſſe credible: nor ſaying that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
Ghoſt ſpake by her mouth hath indecencie,
nor noueltie: and much leſſe the miracle of the
beades; but rather, of all is drawen much profit
for the greater glorie of our Lord and honour of
of his Saint.</p>

noted in this hiſtorie of this bleſſed woman, are
the ſame which are found, and were found, when
they made proofe of them, in many other liues
of Saints, and miracles, and reuelations which
are written of them. Such were thoſe of Saint
Elizabeth, ſiſter of King Eckbert the moſt holy
Abbeſſe of the Monaſtery of Eſconaugia to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
her Angell keeper (as to our bleſſed I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ane hers)
reuealed many things like to theſe, and on Gods
behalfe commanded her to write them, as in her
life is written. Such are thoſe of Saint Hildegar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,
Abbeſſe of the Monasterie of Saint Rupert,
in the dioceſſe of Ments, who from her child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
was much fauoured of our Lord with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelations

                  <p>Some things I haue found in this hiſtory very
particular and rare, which although they are true
and moſt certeine, it is good they be read with
more attention, and greater conſideration: for,
not being ordinarie, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>or ſuch as commonly are

And I my ſelfe ſuppoſe, that being ſuch,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:15857:154"/>
and of the qualitie and truth which I ſpeake of,
they are yet more certeine and more credible,
becauſe God hath reuealed them to this bleſſed
woman. (<hi>Habetur cap. 17. huius hiſtoriae.</hi>) One of
them is, that to this bleſſed Sainte it was reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
how certaine ſoules had their purgatorie in

downe by God, to be generally of all the ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les

purging of the paine of their ſinnes, goe to the

might be truth which this hiſtorie telleth of the

                  <p>There is alſo mention made in this hiſtory,
of a very particular miracle which God wrought
by this bleſſed one, no leſſe worthy to be pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
and conſidered, then this of the ſoules of
purgatorie, concerning certaine roſaries which
the Angell of her garde caried vp to heauen, and
brought from thence, with many benedictions
and virtues granted them by our Sauiour Chriſt,
to the end that the bleſſed one ſhold recite vpon
them, and diuide them amongeſt her nunnes, &amp;

although this miracle is farr aboue all as manie

one only I will relate, for that he ſeemeth
to mee more new, and more like then the others,
to that we haue in this booke; And it is of a tree
very prodigious, which miraculouſly ſprong vp
on a ſodaine in a great field in the ile of Ireland,
in the biſhopprike of Corcke and Clon in the
countie of Deſmon, all loaden with roſaries, like
a vine when it is moſt loden with cluſters of
grapes, and the cordes or ſtringes of the bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
cleauing to the tree, and were faſtned ſo to
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:15857:156"/>
it, as are the ſtalkes of the fruict which groweth
out of whatſomeuer other tree: of this miracle
make mention Francis Belleforeſto a graue au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
and others who haue written after him,
and all doe note that it ſeemed God made it, that
it might appeare how he fauoured &amp; approued
the vſe of holy roſaries. For this was in time that
Almanie was periſhing with the euill ſectes of
the heretiques, to whom was abhominable that
vſe of reciting, and chiefly that of the holy roſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,

                  <p>And it is to be noted, that a little before this
miracle of theſe roſaries and bleſſed beades had
fallen out, which the Angell brought from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to this B. maide, and conſequently it may be
beleeued that God alſo wrought it, not only for
the comforte of his ſeruant, &amp; ſo deere eſpouſe,
but alſo as that other of Ireland, for greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of the deuotion of the faithfull &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
of the heretiques of thoſe times, yet there
is one thing very particular and rare in theſe ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
which her good Angell brought to the B.

not in any other of as many things as by

read, that the Angels haue caried them from the

and made there miraculouſly, or brought
from heauen, like many other things; as the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſula

that childe as he was to be caried vp to heauen,
neither is there for vs to beleeue that this might
be ſo which of theſe beades, and roſaries is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten:
and a mightie argument to beleeue this is,
as alſo all whatſoeuer in this matter els is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
to ſee the many miracles which with theſe
beades God doth daily; of which the author
doth relate ſome, and I haue ſeene with my eyes
the informations and authenticall probations, &amp;
thoſe of many ſworne witneſſes, from whome
with much truth and fidelitie he hath drawen all
that he ſayeth. And I will not tell what I haue
knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that happened with one of theſe beades,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:15857:158"/>
which by particular fauour done me by God I
haue obteyned &amp; hold in my power, that I may
not more enlarge my ſelfe in this my relation:
God grant that in ſome other occaſion it may be
knowen.</p>
                  <p>It is alſo neceſſarie to be conſidered, and I
haue conſidered, how that ought to be taken
which is recounted in this hiſtorie. (<hi>Habetur cap.
16. huius historiae</hi>) How it was reuealed to the B.
Ioane, that the Archangell S. Michaell did iudge
the ſoules after they departed from the bodies,
doing the office of ſupreme iudge, of great pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and preheminencie, with enſignes of crowne
imperiall, ſcepter, and tribunall of great Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie.
This, taking it in the ſenſe it ought to be
taken, can not haue difficultie for the beliefe,
for it neither is againſt that which the ſacred
and the ſcholaſticall Doctors doe teach, nor doth
any thing derogate from the iudiciarie power of
God. For taking it for the ſupreme, abſolutely it
is only in God; and takinge it for the power of
excellencie and ſingular, immediatly participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of that ſupreme, it is ſo ſolely in Chriſt our
Sauiour in as much as he is man, according to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
that for this they expound that place of
S. Ioan: 5. <hi>Omne iudicium dedit filio.</hi> Nor is it hard
to beleeue; for with this it is compatible, that
there be other inferiour iudges which participate
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:15857:159"/>
of the power of God, and may be called iudges
of ſoules. As it derogateth nothing to the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie
and independence of the firſt cauſe, to
haue other ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d caſes, together with the which
it may worke, concurr and doe his effects. And
ſo without any repugnance, in this ſenſe is it ſaid
that alſo the Saints ſhall iudge the nations. (<hi>Sap.</hi>

that ſittinge with him they ſhoulde iudge the

                  <p>Then S. Michael being an Archa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gel of ſo great
excellencie and Maieſtie, as the manie and verie
great titles which the church giueth him, and
the honorable epithetes which ſhe ſingeth to

to beleue that which of him this bleſſed one hath

And this is very conforme to the ſtile and vſe
which the church hath to declare vs this power
and this greatneſſe of S. Michaell. For as verie
well ſaide the moſt learned and pious Doctor
Iohn Molanus in his booke of Images. (<hi>Lib. 2.
cap.</hi> 28.) This we haue ſayed, is the ſame which
is repreſented vnto vs in pictures where they
paint S. Michaell with a ballance in his hand: for
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:15857:160"/>
it is as much as to ſay vnto vs, that as a iudge vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
and of great integritie, firſt he pondereth
&amp; weigheth the merites of the ſoules with great
particularitie, and euerie one by it ſelfe, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward,
pronounceth the ſentence vpon them.
The ſame ſaith that moſt ſtout defender of the
faith, Iohn Eckius, and other authors. (<hi>Hom. 8.
de S. Michaele &amp; relatus à Ioanne Molane.</hi>) Which
ſpeake of the ſame, and after the ſame manner
muſt be vnderſtood what in that reuelation our
bleſſed one doth ſay, that forthwith at the ſame
inſtant that S. Michaell hath pronounced the
ſentence againſt the euill ſoules, other Angells,
as executors of this ſentence, doe begin to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtize
with rigorous ſtripes thoſe ſoules; which is
to ſay, that in the ſame inſtant they doe begin to
feele and ſuffer the rigorous whipp of the iuſt
chaſtiſement of God, and of the paines which
for them he hath prepared. And I ſay no more
of that which remaineth of this hiſtorie, for it
is all very facill, and there is nothing wheron to
repaire, and more I confeſſe, that if I were not
commanded to ſpeake what hath beene ſaide, I
could very well haue excuſed it, for al theſe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
doth the author very well declare and ponder
in their places ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>earnedly, that he leaueth not
whence to doubte in this nor in any other thing:
for not only in that which is hiſtoricall he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:15857:160"/>
with ſo much certeintie and ſecuritie in
this his worke, ſpeaking in moſt thinges of it as
an eye witneſſe: but alſo in that which is Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logicall
and the reaſon of the hiſtorie, he procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
with great ground, and with reaſons verie
ſolide and with Theologicall: for the which are
due to the author many thankes for hauing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
this ſo holy occupation, and ſo impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
for the ſpirite &amp; profit of ſoules and for the
greater glorie of God, and of his holie religion,
and of the glorious Father and Patriarche Saint
Francis, who daily with new birthes and ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings

And for all the aforeſaide doe admitt him
